CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES

Dealing With Social Difficulty During Adolescence:
The Role of Implicit Theories of Personality
David S. Yeager
University of Texas at Austin

ABSTRACT—Social

difficulty during adolescence contributes to internalizing problems (e.g., depression, stress)
and spurs cycles of aggression and retaliation. In this article, I review how implicit theories of personality—beliefs
about whether people can change their socially relevant
characteristics—cause some adolescents to respond to
social difficulty in these ways while others do not. Believing an entity theory of personality—the belief that people
cannot change—causes people to blame their own and
others’ traits for social difficulty, and predicts more
extreme affective, physiological, and behavioral responses
(e.g., depression, aggression). Interventions that teach an
incremental theory of personality—the belief that people
can change—can reduce problematic reactions to social
difficulty. I discuss why interventions to alter implicit
theories improve adolescents’ responses to conflict, and I
propose suggestions for research.

KEYWORDS—implicit

Why do some young people respond to social difficulties such
as peer victimization and exclusion with despair or a thirst for
revenge, while others find more productive ways of coping?1
Adolescents suffer more when they blame their social difficulties
on their flawed traits (3), and they want to lash out more when
they conclude their peers are fundamentally bad people who
deserve to suffer (4). These fixed-trait attributions are problematic in part because of what they portend. Illustrating this, a
ninth-grade student once asked me, “If my friends make fun of
me or don’t ask me to sit with them at lunch, does that mean I’ll
have no friends for life? That they’ll make fun of me forever?”
This is a stressful thought that might elicit extreme emotion or
action.
Our research has identified the mindsets, or implicit theories
of personality, that can underlie such thoughts. Because implicit
theories can be altered through intervention (and perhaps socialization), they represent one way to help adolescents deal more
effectively with social difficulty. In this article, I review basic
processes through which implicit theories shape responses to
social difficulty, using the process model of emotion regulation
(5) as an organizing framework. Next, I examine intervention
studies that demonstrate causality and practical impact, followed
by a discussion of promising areas for research.
IMPLICIT THEORIES: HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL LIFE
FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES

Implicit theories are beliefs about the malleability of human
characteristics (6). According to an entity theory of personality,
people’s socially relevant traits (e.g., whether they are mean or
nice people, whether they are likable or not) are fixed and

unchangeable. According to an incremental theory of personality, people can change their socially relevant traits. These
implicit theories of personality—entity and incremental—can
create different worldviews through which people interpret and
respond to social conflicts with peers (e.g., victimization and
exclusion; 7).2

Table 1
The Experience of Being Subjected to High School Social Conflict
from Two Worldviews: Entity and Incremental Theories of
Personality.

Worldview
The different implicit theories imply worldviews that shape the
way we strive for goals. Adolescents who ascribe to an entity
theory tend to endorse the goal of demonstrating social success
or avoiding demonstrating social ineptitude (i.e., a performance
approach or avoidance goal; 9, 10). This is because, if traits are
fixed, it is threatening to be identified as lacking in social status
or competence. However, those who ascribe to an incremental
theory tend to endorse the goal of learning how to develop social
competence or relationships (11). Often, adolescents pursue this
goal by putting themselves in socially challenging situations
where they can acquire more friendship skills or repair relationships with others (10, 12).
The entity and incremental theories—and the social goals that
emanate from them (13)—shape reactions to social difficulties
like bullying, victimization, and exclusion. Consider how implicit theories affect each step in the process model of coping (5):
Depending on what implicit theories of personality people
believe, they may show different patterns of attention, appraisal,
and responses when they face socially difficult situations (see
Table 1 and Figure 1).

Worldview
Beliefs
Goals

Attention and Information-Seeking
Implicit theories affect the kinds of information people think is
relevant to their social conflict. A person who ascribes to an
incremental theory might ask: What was the person’s psychology
—the person’s motivations, beliefs, thoughts, or feelings? By
contrast, someone who ascribes to an entity theory might ask:
What kind of person would do this (14, 15)?
Moreover, for someone who ascribes to more of an entity theory and prioritizes the goal of demonstrating social competence
or status, attention is allocated more toward peers’ status and
social rank or underlying traits (16; see Table 1, row 3). For
instance, in one study, adolescents who believed in an entity
theory more readily sorted the social world in terms of who was
popular or unpopular rather than in terms of qualities like personal interests (17). Furthermore, when judging a person who
harmed others, adolescents who believed in an entity theory

2
For this review, I do not differentiate implicit theories about the malleability of
one’s own versus others’ traits. In our experience, the two go hand in hand. When
we feel our own traits are fixed, we expect that others will treat us the same way
forever. When we feel others’ traits are fixed, it can lead to the same conclusion.
Although in general, the closer an implicit theory is to the domain of the outcome,
the more predictive it will be (8), we have not yet found different associations for
self theories of personality versus other theories. To reflect the state of the evidence so far, I discuss them jointly.

(see Table 1, row 4, and Figure 1). They shape attributions for
cause and effect, and these attributions can affect judgments of

effective coping outcomes in response to peer social conflict during the transition to high school. Model based on (5).

how demanding a stressor seems and whether one has the
resources to deal with it. In a study, participants who ascribed
to an entity theory were more likely to view an accidental conflict (e.g., a peer bumping into you in the hallway) as having
been done intentionally to be mean (i.e., the hostile attributional
bias; 18, 19). The same was true for participants who had a negative experience where hostile intent was unclear, such as ostracism during an online game of catch with two peers (i.e.,
Cyberball; 19, 20). Ascribing to an entity theory also predicts
trait-relevant attributions for both accidental and obviously
intended conflicts. High school students who believed in an
entity theory were more likely to say a peer who made fun of
and embarrassed them was a bad person (4), and fifth-graders
were more likely to wonder if failing socially with peers meant
they were not likable (10). These kinds of fixed-trait attributions,
in turn, create the perception that the bad things happening now
can never change (see Table 1, row 5).
New research has moved from intent and trait attributions to
the appraisal processes commonly studied in the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat (21, 22; see Table 1, row 6).
Physiological responses to a stressor are shaped by whether
individuals feel they have the resources to cope with the

demands facing them (i.e., the ratio of perceived resources to
perceived demand; 21, 22). Individuals experience threat when
they appraise the demand as greater than the resources and
challenge when they appraise the resources as sufficient to meet
the demand.
Belief in an entity theory predicts more of a threat appraisal
to stressors—that is, it calls into question whether fixed traits
are up to the task of social success. In two studies (23), an
incremental theory of personality created less of a threat appraisal and more of a challenge appraisal, both in response to a
stressor (having to give a speech to upperclass students about
what makes someone popular) and to typical events in high
school (as reported in a daily diary).
Responses
These different appraisals give rise to different responses
depending on one’s implicit theory, again at many levels of analysis (see Table 1, rows 7–10). Physiologically, threat-type
appraisals lead to cardiovascular and hormonal responses that
prepare the body for damage and defeat: constricted blood vessels and secretion of cortisol (activation of the HPA axis; 21,
22). Ascribing to an incremental theory, which promotes more

challenge-type appraisals, reduces adolescents’ threat-type
physiological responses when they are evaluated negatively by a
peer (23; see also 24 for a replication).
Furthermore, adolescents report different emotions after being
victimized and excluded by peers, depending on the implicit
theories to which they ascribe. Those with an entity theory of
personality are more likely to report self-relevant emotions such
as shame, humiliation, and hatred (4). These emotions differ
from more situation-focused emotions such as anger or sadness
because they stem from the judgment that a person’s core is
flawed; with shame, the emotion stems from the belief that the
self is bad (25), and with hatred, that another person’s core self
is bad or evil (26). In one study, ascribing to an incremental theory reduced shame and hatred after serious bullying, but did not
reduce anger or sadness (4). Thus, believing in an incremental
theory does not make someone oblivious to the injustice of being
victimized; victims are still sad and angry. However, believing
in an incremental theory helps adolescents avoid destructive
emotions like shame and hatred (26).
Finally, the different coping processes created by implicit theories of personality sometimes translate into different overall
levels of internalizing or externalizing responses (see Table 1,
rows 7–10 and the bottom of Figure 1). In a meta-analysis,
ascribing to an entity theory of personality predicted both
depression and aggression in adolescence (27). In our studies,
we gave adolescents hypothetical scenarios of bullying or victimization or put them in experimental situations in which they
were excluded by peers (i.e. Cyberball; 20). In response to either
situation, adolescents who ascribed to an entity theory expressed
greater desire to retaliate and get revenge (4). Those who
believed in an entity theory expected that getting revenge would
make them feel better. In contrast, adolescents who believed in
an incremental theory had less desire for aggression and less of
an expectation that revenge would improve their mood (4).
CHANGING IMPLICIT THEORIES THROUGH
PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION

Implicit theories of personality are typically stable because
adults rarely teach such theories explicitly to young people.
However, adolescents can be redirected toward more of an
incremental theory with targeted interventions. When this happens, adolescents cope more effectively. Interventions designed
to encourage adolescents to adopt an incremental theory of personality illustrate that people can change their socially relevant
characteristics at any age, under the right conditions, and with
the right support. The interventions contain three messages.
First, they teach that people do not do things because of their
labels (e.g., bully, jerk), but because of their thoughts and feelings, which are located in the brain. Second, an individual’s
thoughts and feelings can change when the brain learns new
ways to view and deal with the social world. Third, this potential
for change means that people are not stuck being one way—that

people who are mean, who bully, or who exclude are not going
to act that way forever but, with the right support, can see that
what they are doing is harmful, and then change. This can provide a basis for hope.
In the interventions, these messages are wrapped in now-standard tactics for wise interventions—that is, ways to produce
internalization of novel worldviews (28). The interventions use
scientific authority (by summarizing neuroscientific findings),
align the message with descriptive social norms (by presenting
statistical information and narrative summaries of older students
who endorse the view that people can change; 29), and implement saying-is-believing activities (by inviting participants to
write a persuasive, comforting letter to a future, excluded student who might be bullied but not yet know that people can
change; 30). The interventions are not passive (they do not tell
adolescents what to think) but active (they ask adolescents to
draw on personal wisdom and pass it on to others).
The first intervention my colleagues and I conducted to introduce youth to the incremental theory of personality was a sixsession workshop in high school science classes at a low-income
school (31). Our study featured two control groups—a group that
took part in a six-session intervention that taught social-emotional coping skills (but no incremental theory) and a group that
received no lessons on these topics. A month after the intervention, students who participated in the classroom workshops on
incremental theory retaliated less toward a peer who excluded
them (via Cyberball). Three and a half months later, those who
took part in the workshop were nominated by their teachers (who
were blind to condition) for having fewer conduct problems than
students in the control groups (31). Students who were taught
social-emotional coping skills showed no change in social behavior compared to the group that received no lessons (32). Critical
for our theory, in the group that was taught the incremental theory of personality, the long-term effects were greatest among
those who had the most social difficulty. That is, students’ conduct problems were reduced the most among those who reported
they had been chronically victimized by peers (31).
Subsequent interventions to promote an incremental theory
have been more compact, involving a 30- to 45-minute selfadministered reading and writing exercise delivered on paper or
via the Internet. In experiments in high schools, adolescents
who received the incremental theory intervention coped with the
social difficulties of moving to high school more productively
than students who received a parallel control exercise. Treated
adolescents reported less overall stress and earned higher grades
during freshman year of high school, which can be a difficult
time socially (23, 33). In another study, entering ninth-graders
who took part in the incremental theory intervention showed
40% fewer depressive symptoms 8–9 months after the intervention, and the effect was more prominent for those who started
the year ascribing to an entity theory of personality (34, 35). In
a replication study, this effect on internalizing symptoms did not
generalize to a group of entering college students a month later

Implicit Theories of Personality

(34), but in a different replication study, the effect on physiological reactivity that precedes internalizing symptoms generalized
to clinically referred adolescents (24). These initial results are
encouraging enough to continue replications, but the intervention is not ready to be implemented at full scale.
LOOKING AHEAD

Researchers can continue this work by focusing on several areas
and building on the unknown areas in the process model in Figure 1. First, can incremental theories of personality reduce bullying, not just responses to victimization and exclusion? Perhaps
those who ascribe to an entity theory—believing that any instance
of social failure would label them a loser forever—maintain a
keen vigilance to threats to status, and then attack others’ status
strategically and preemptively to preserve their own. If this is the
case, an incremental theory intervention might dampen adolescents’ urges to harm others’ reputations by bullying them.
Second, and relatedly, we know little about the behavioral and
environmental mediators of treatments involving the incremental
theory of personality. Do youth who take part in such interventions start making more friends, and do these stronger relationships with peers sustain the effects of the intervention (as
suggested in Figure 1; also cf. 36)? Or are the relevant mediators solely internal to a young person’s psychology? Schoolbased research that replicates implicit theories interventions
and assesses personal and situational moderators could address
these and other possibilities outlined in Figure 1.
Third, how can adults socialize young people to believe an
incremental theory of personality? In the intelligence domain,
telling children “You must be smart at that” communicated an
entity theory of intelligence (37). Providing comforting words
such as “It’s okay, not everybody can be good at math” encouraged hopelessness (38). In the personality domain, parents
sometimes use phrases that invite fixed explanations for differences among people (39, 40), such as “Don’t worry, they’re just
bullies” or “You’re a good person, they’re not.” This language
may not provide relief if it promotes fixed-trait thinking. Indeed,
in one study (41), a common message for LGBTQ youth who
were bullied—the “It gets better” social media campaign—was
that life improves because you can escape your hometown and
move to San Francisco or New York, cities with more tolerant
views of the LGBTQ community. This message increased despair for LGBTQ youth by implying that bullies can never
change. It was only when youth were told that “it gets better”
because society’s views can change over time and peer tormenters might become enlightened one day that LGBTQ youth
felt comforted (41).
CONCLUSION

Research on implicit theories, applied to the social lives of
adolescents, has helped explain differences in how adolescents

5

deal with peer victimization and exclusion, and has informed
interventions. The next phase of research will investigate additional mechanisms, antecedents, and effects at scale across
social contexts. Measures will hopefully improve. After this
research, interventions involving the incremental theory of personality may help ameliorate some of the internalizing and
externalizing consequences of social difficulty in adolescents.
