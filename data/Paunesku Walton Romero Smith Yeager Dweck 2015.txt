Abstract
The efficacy of academic-mind-set interventions has been demonstrated by small-scale, proof-of-concept interventions,
generally delivered in person in one school at a time. Whether this approach could be a practical way to raise school
achievement on a large scale remains unknown. We therefore delivered brief growth-mind-set and sense-of-purpose
interventions through online modules to 1,594 students in 13 geographically diverse high schools. Both interventions
were intended to help students persist when they experienced academic difficulty; thus, both were predicted to be
most beneficial for poorly performing students. This was the case. Among students at risk of dropping out of high
school (one third of the sample), each intervention raised students’ semester grade point averages in core academic
courses and increased the rate at which students performed satisfactorily in core courses by 6.4 percentage points. We
discuss implications for the pipeline from theory to practice and for education reform.

Every year, high-quality articles published in the finest
journals demonstrate the power of psychological interventions to bring about meaningful change in academic
achievement (e.g., J. Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002;
Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Cohen, Garcia,
Purdie-Vaughns, Apfel, & Brzustoski, 2009; Good, Aronson,
& Inzlicht, 2003; Harackiewicz, Rozek, Hulleman, & Hyde,
2012; Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009; Jamieson, Mendes,
Blackstock, & Schmader, 2010; Sherman et  al., 2013;
Walton & Cohen, 2011; Wilson & Linville, 1982, 1985). Yet
a critical limitation of these interventions is they are rarely
tested in ways that can be readily scaled up. They often
require that researchers be extensively and personally
involved at school sites to ensure appropriate delivery of
the intervention (see Yeager & Walton, 2011). It is therefore unclear whether any published psychological intervention can move beyond a boutique remedy to raise
achievement or close achievement gaps for large numbers
of students. In the study reported here, we addressed that
issue. We tested, for the first time, whether psychological
interventions could practically be deployed to raise academic achievement on a wide-scale.

Our focus is on underperformance in U.S. high
schools. Millions of students drop out of high school
every year. They tend to be unprepared for either college
or the workforce and consequently suffer poorer job
prospects, worse health, and higher incarceration rates
than people who complete high school (Dianda, 2008).
President Obama recently identified improvement in
educational outcomes as one of the highest domestic priorities in the United States (U.S. Department of Education,
2014). Of course, many reforms have been tried, including improvements to teacher training, accountability
mechanisms, school structures, and curricula, often at
high cost and with limited success (e.g., Fullan, 2001;
Glazerman et  al., 2010). Yet no major reform has

A Scalable Intervention for Academic Underachievement
prioritized students’ psychological experience in school
or motivation to succeed, despite the fact that it is ultimately students themselves who must capitalize on learning opportunities. Can psychological science provide
scalable techniques to improve students’ approach to
learning and achievement in high school?
Although social-psychological or academic-mind-set
interventions (Farrington et al., 2012) have been influential, none of them have been tested in ways that are
potentially scalable. The problem is not so much that
past interventions included small samples but that they
have generally been tested in only one context at a time
and with far greater researcher involvement and control
than would be feasible in a large-scale implementation
(Farrington et  al., 2012; Yeager & Walton, 2011). This
includes tailoring materials for each school site, extensive
training of participating faculty, and exerting close control over the context and timing of intervention delivery.
These studies provide important tests of psychological
theory and its application. However, if interventions are
not tested in realistic ways with broad samples and minimal researcher input, they remain only exemplary test
cases whose practical impact on education outcomes is
unclear. As Bryk, Gomez, and Grunow (2011) wrote, “the
history of educational innovation is replete with stories
that show how innovations work in the hands of a few,
but lose effectiveness in the hands of the many” (p. 130).
Are academic-mind-set interventions a practical way
to raise achievement in the United States, especially for
underperforming students? If so, this would constitute a
major contribution of psychological science to social policy and justify increased investment in psychological
approaches to educational and social improvement.
To examine whether mind-set interventions could be
effective at scale, we transformed existing in-person
interventions into brief computer-based modules.
Computerized interventions allow materials to be delivered to recipients exactly as designed without extensive
researcher involvement or facilitator training; they eliminate geographic constraints, opening access to students
at multiple school sites and sites far from research centers; and they drastically reduce logistical burdens, the
marginal cost of additional participants, and the costs of
data collection and large-scale evaluation (Marks,
Cavanagh, & Gega, 2007).
We tested two mind-set interventions—one for growth
mind-set of intelligence1 and a second for sense of purpose—with more than 1,500 students in 13 high schools.
The primary outcomes were grades and satisfactory completion rates in core academic subjects. We focused on
effects among poorly performing students, because
mind-sets matter most when students encounter challenges in school (Burnette, O’Boyle, VanEpps, Pollack, &
Finkel, 2013; Dweck & Leggett, 1988).

Academic-Mind-Set Interventions
Academic-mind-set interventions target students’ core
beliefs about school and learning, such as “Can I learn
and grow my intelligence?” (growth-mind-set beliefs) and
“Why should I learn?” (sense-of-purpose beliefs). In so
doing, they can change how students interpret and
respond to challenges in school, increase students’ resilience, and set in motion positive recursive cycles that
increase success over time (Garcia & Cohen, 2012; Yeager
& Walton, 2011).
Growth-mind-set interventions convey that intelligence can grow when students work hard on challenging
tasks—and thus that struggle is an opportunity for
growth, not a sign that a student is incapable of learning.
Past studies featuring activities led by researchers or
researcher-trained tutors show that this message can raise
students’ achievement. In a seminal study, J. Aronson and
his colleagues (2002) taught a growth mind-set to college
students in three 1-hr laboratory sessions and then
encouraged students to internalize this message by teaching it to struggling middle school students. This experience raised the college students’ semester grade point
averages (GPAs). In another study, an eight-session
growth-mind-set workshop led by researchers raised the
math grades of low-achieving seventh-grade students
(Blackwell et  al., 2007; see also Good et  al., 2003).
Because growth-mind-set interventions help students
understand challenges in school in a way that promotes
learning and resilience, they may be most beneficial for
underperforming students (Burnette et al., 2013).
Sense-of-purpose interventions encourage students to
reflect on how working hard and learning in school can
help them accomplish meaningful goals beyond the self,
such as contributing to their community or being examples for other people (Yeager & Bundick, 2009; Yeager,
Henderson, D’Mello, et al., 2014). They draw on relevance interventions (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009),
which help students relate course content to their lives.
However, they are framed more broadly, in terms of the
value of school in general. Like relevance interventions,
sense-of-purpose interventions can sustain students’
motivation when schoolwork is boring or frustrating but
foundational to learning. In so doing, they can raise
achievement, especially among underperforming students (Yeager, Henderson, D’Mello, et al., 2014).
Because mind-set interventions typically target a single keystone belief, they can be brief (e.g., an hour or
less) and can be delivered using standardized materials
(Cohen et  al., 2009; Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009;
Walton & Cohen, 2011; see Walton, 2014). We focused on
growth-mind-set and sense-of-purpose interventions
because they seemed most suitable to an initial effort to
scale such interventions to heterogeneous settings. They

do not require customization to course content (unlike,
e.g., Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) or reference students’ school context (unlike, e.g., Walton & Cohen,
2011). They use common narratives (e.g., stories from
older students) and objective information (e.g., scientific
concepts) to change core beliefs about school ( J. Aronson
et al., 2002). In this way, such interventions can be distributed in a more flexible array of situations than more
experiential interventions, which may need to take place
within the classroom itself (e.g., Cohen et  al., 2009).
Furthermore, they benefit underperforming students
broadly, unlike interventions that focus on the psychological experience of students from negatively stereotyped groups (e.g., Cohen et al., 2009; Walton & Cohen,
2011).
We took a number of steps to test the interventions
under realistic circumstances like those that would be in
force when the interventions were scaled-up. We included
a heterogeneous sample of schools even though this
introduced more variance in outcomes, and we allowed
schools to control when and by whom intervention activities would be administered. To retain schools that could
not offer extended time for the study, we also dispensed
with extensive survey batteries and psychological process measures such as daily diaries (e.g., Walton & Cohen,
2011). By taking these steps and reducing the “superrealization bias” (Cronbach et al., 1980) that can lead to
large effect sizes in trials with small, highly controlled
samples (Ioannidis, Cappelleri, & Lau, 1998; Slavin &
Smith, 2009), we expected to find more modest but more
realistic and broadly reliable effects.
When psychological-science researchers examine
social problems, the remedies that emerge from their
research are often impractical or not tested in ways that
can be meaningfully scaled up. This is perhaps one reason why psychological science has played only a limited
role in many major policy debates. In the current study,
we tested whether academic-mind-set interventions can
have a meaningful impact on academic outcomes when
delivered to a large sample in a scalable way. If so, our
results could stand as a model for research that takes
theory into practice.

Method
Participating schools and students
Thirteen high schools, recruited through a series of presentations to educators or brief phone meetings, agreed to
participate and provide participating students’ academic
records. The schools were located in the eastern, western,
and southwestern United States. Eight were public schools,
four were charter schools, and one was a private school.
They varied widely in socioeconomic characteristics: In

five schools, almost no students received free or reduced
lunch because of low household income; in six, more
than half of students did (see Table 1).
To maximize external validity and power, we sought
to include as many students as possible in the study.
Consequently, we permitted all interested schools to take
part provided that they agreed to try to enroll 100 or
more students and to provide academic outcomes for
participating students (not all schools reached this benchmark). Our analyses focus on the 1,594 students for
whom both preintervention and postintervention semester grades were available.

Procedure
Participating schools were asked to select a study coordinator who would recruit teachers to participate and follow-up with teachers if classrooms lagged. The
coordinator asked teachers to create accounts on the
study Web site (http://www.perts.net) and to schedule
two 45-min sessions about 2 weeks apart (mean = 13
days). Both sessions were administered in the school
computer lab during the spring semester, between
January and May 2012. In an online registration process,
teachers agreed to describe the activities to students as a
part of an ongoing Stanford University study about why
and how students learn. After signing into the study Web
site, each student was individually randomly assigned to
a control condition or to one of three intervention conditions: growth-mind-set intervention, sense-of-purpose
intervention, or the two interventions combined. For all
groups, the growth-mind-set intervention (or related control materials) was delivered in Session 1; the sense-ofpurpose intervention (or related control materials) was
delivered in Session 2. Students from all four conditions
thus took part in both sessions.
The growth-mind-set intervention drew directly on
past research ( J. Aronson et  al., 2002; Blackwell et  al.,
2007; Good et al., 2003) for both content and procedures;
however, the material was revised to be effective within
a single 45-min online session. Students read an article
describing the brain’s ability to grow and reorganize itself
as a consequence of hard work and good strategies on
challenging tasks. The article focused on the implications
of neuroscience findings for students’ potential to become
more intelligent through study and practice. In keeping
with our focus on underperforming students, the article
stressed the fact that struggle and setbacks in school do
not indicate limited potential; rather, they provide opportunities to learn. This message was reinforced through
two writing exercises (see E. Aronson, 1999; J. Aronson
et al., 2002). In one, students summarized the scientific
findings in their own words. In the second, they read
about a hypothetical student who was becoming

discouraged and beginning to think of himself as not
smart enough to do well in school. Participating students
were asked to use what they had read to advise this student. In the control condition, students read and completed similar-seeming materials; however, these materials
focused on functional localization in the brain, not neural
plasticity. They thus lacked the key psychological message that intelligence is malleable.
The sense-of-purpose intervention was designed to
help students articulate how schoolwork could help them
accomplish meaningful, beyond-the-self life goals. The
materials also drew directly on past research (Yeager,
Henderson, D’Mello, et al., 2014). In the intervention, the
students were first asked to write briefly about how they
wished the world could be a better place. It went on to say
that many students work hard in school because they want
to grow up to “make a positive impact on the world,” to
“make their families proud,” or to be “a good example for
other people.” Students were then asked to think about
their own goals and to write about how learning and
working hard in school could help them achieve these
goals. In the control condition, students completed either
of two similarly formatted modules that did not differ from
each other in their impact, ts < 1, and were combined in
analyses. One asked students to describe how their lives
were different in high school than before high school. The
other was very similar to the sense-of-purpose treatment but
put forward economic self-interest rather than prosocial
contribution as a reason to work hard in school. We included
this second control condition to establish that focusing on
beyond-the-self goals, not just any personal future goal, is
an important component of the intervention, a hypothesis

supported by prior work (Yeager, Henderson, D’Mello,
et al., 2014; Yeager & Bundick, 2009).
All students who entered the study and for whom preand postintervention grades were available were included
in the analyses (e.g., students who completed Session 1
but not Session 2 are retained with their original random
condition assignment). Thus, we performed an intentionto-treat analysis. Sample demographics are presented in
Table 2. Degrees of freedom varied because not all students completed all survey questions.

Psychological measures
Brief psychological measures were administered at the
start of Session 1 and at the end of Session 2. First, to
confirm that the growth-mind-set intervention changed
students’ beliefs about the malleability of intelligence, we
assessed this belief using two items: “You can learn new
things, but you can’t really change your basic intelligence” and “You have a certain amount of intelligence
and you really can’t do much to change it” (α = .84; see
Blackwell et  al., 2007). Second, we examined students’
construal of mundane academic tasks using a meaningfulness-of-schoolwork task (Yeager, Henderson, D’Mello,
et al., 2014; see also Steger, Bundick, & Yeager, 2012),
which assesses whether students view schoolwork (e.g.,
“Doing your math homework”) at a low, mechanical level
(e.g., “Typing numbers into a calculator and writing formulas”) or at a high level relevant to learning and growth
(“Building your problem-solving skills”; see Michaels,
Parkin, & Vallacher, 2013). Eight items formed a reliable
composite, α = .72. Although this measure is more closely

Note: Data on individual students’ socioeconomic status (SES) were
not collected; however, the percentage of students receiving free or
reduced-price lunches, a measure of school-level SES, was known
for all public and charter schools (12 of 13 participating schools; see
Table 1).

matched to the purpose of schoolwork, it seemed reasonable that the results of the meaningfulness-of-schoolwork task could be influenced by both interventions
insofar as both interventions attempted to induce students to perceive the purpose of schoolwork to be learning and growth.

Measures of academic performance
Schools provided participating students’ transcripts. Ten
schools coded students’ performance on a five-letter
grading scale (A, B, C, D, F), whereas three assigned “no
credit” (NC) in place of Ds and Fs. To numerically transform letter grades for analysis, we always coded A, B, and
C as 4, 3, and 2, respectively. Because there was no single
a priori basis by which to code D, F, and NC, we used
three schemes: D = 1, F = 0, and NC = missing; D = 1, F =
1, and NC = 1 (because they are all unsatisfactory); or F =
0, D = 1, and NC = 1 (because D and NC are immediately
below C). The current results are presented using the
final coding scheme because it (a) retained all data
(unlike the first scheme) and (b) distinguished between F
and D (unlike the second scheme); however, all three
coding methods provided comparable results. We also
created a dichotomous measure of unsatisfactory progress, with grades of D, F, NC, and incomplete (I) marked
as unsatisfactory and grades of A, B, C, pass (P), and
credit (CR) marked as satisfactory.
We calculated each student’s end-of-semester GPA in
core academic courses (i.e., math, English, science, and
social studies) in the fall (preintervention) and in the spring
(postintervention). We focused on core academic courses

because these courses are generally most crucial to students’ success and because they are the most challenging
(mean core GPA = 2.45; mean noncore GPA = 3.15). Thus,
they are the most relevant to the interventions.2

Results
Baseline associations
After we controlled for school, race, and gender, prestudy
GPA was positively associated with baseline values for both
growth mind-set, β = 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
[0.03, 0.09], t(1561) = 3.47, p < .001, and sense of purpose,
β = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.08], t(1551) = 2.67, p = .008.

Manipulation checks
A linear regression analysis in which we controlled for
prestudy beliefs about intelligence showed that the
growth-mind-set intervention led to a more malleable
view of intelligence, β = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.28],
t(1007) = 2.82, p = .005, but the sense-of-purpose and
combined interventions did not, ps > .24.
A linear regression controlling for preintervention
meaningfulness of schoolwork showed that the sense-ofpurpose group perceived mundane academic tasks as
more relevant to learning and growth than did the control group, β = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.32], t(1000) = 2.37,
p = .018; this was also true for the growth-mind-set group,
but only marginally, β = 0.11, 95% CI = [−0.01, 0.23],
t(1000) = 1.77, p = .078. The combined interventions
again showed no significant effect, t < 1.

Grade point average
To determine whether the intervention influenced poststudy GPA and did so to a greater extent for students with
a history of underperformance, we tested whether intervention effects would emerge among students who met
“high-yield” indicators of dropping out from high school.
This threshold was created by the Consortium for Chicago
School Research using decades of official records from
Chicago public schools (see Allensworth & Easton, 2007;
Heppen & Therriault, 2008). In our sample, 519 students
(33%) earned a baseline first-semester GPA of 2.0 or less
or failed at least one core academic course.
In the semester before the intervention, the intervention and control groups did not differ in GPA, ts < 1. We
conducted a linear regression analysis that included risk
(0 = not at risk, 1 = at risk), a dummy variable for each
intervention condition, and a dummy variable for each
Risk × Intervention (growth mind-set, sense of purpose,
combined) interaction. The outcome was core GPA for
the semester after intervention. We controlled for prestudy
GPA, race, gender, and school. The regression revealed

the predicted Risk × Intervention interaction for each
intervention condition: This interaction was significant
for the growth-mind-set intervention, b = 0.13, 95% CI =
[0.00, 0.26], t(1568) = 1.97, p = .048, and the sense-ofpurpose intervention, b = 0.17, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.32],
t(1568) = 2.31, p = .021, and it was marginally significant
for the combined interventions, b = 0.14, 95% CI = [−0.01,
0.28], t(1568) = 1.81, p = .071 (Fig. 1).
Because our primary research question concerned the
efficacy of academic-mind-set interventions in general
when delivered via online modules, we then collapsed
the intervention conditions into a single intervention
dummy code (0 = control, 1 = intervention). We again
controlled for prestudy GPA, race, gender, and school.
The regression analysis revealed a significant At Risk ×
Intervention interaction, b = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.25],
t(1572) = 2.56, p = .011, such that the intervention effect
was significant among at-risk students, b = 0.13, 95% CI =
[0.02, 0.25], t(499) = 2.30, p = .022, but not among other
students, t < 1.3 The three intervention conditions produced similar benefits for at-risk students (mean change
in GPA—control condition: 0.04; growth-mind-set condition: 0.15, sense-of-purpose condition: 0.18, combinedinterventions condition: 0.13),4 and the effect of
intervention among at-risk students was not moderated
by race or gender, ps > .21.

It is intriguing that students who received both interventions did not show greater benefits. To our knowledge, only two past studies have tested the effects of
combining mind-set interventions; neither found that the
combination yielded greater benefits than the individual
interventions (Good et al., 2003; Yeager, Walton, Brady,
et al., 2014, Experiment 2). Why? In the case of the present study, one possibility is that the two psychological
messages were not integrated. Absent this, it may have
been difficult for students to fully incorporate two simultaneous and distinct changes to their basic beliefs about
schoolwork; that is, students may have received only a
partial “dose” of each intervention. This interpretation is
consistent with the lack of manipulation-check effects in
the combined condition (for a similar pattern, see Yeager,
Walton, Brady, et al., 2014, Experiment 2). Future research
on combined interventions should integrate the chosen
interventions so that they enhance and support each
other rather than presenting separate and possibly confusing messages about learning and school.5

Satisfactory performance
Satisfactory grades (e.g., A, B, C) denote minimal acceptable proficiency in a subject and are often required for
entry into higher-level courses. To assess whether the

Fig. 2. The effect of the interventions on satisfactory course completion in core courses among students at risk of dropping out of high
school. The graphs in (a) show the percentage of students who received satisfactory grades (A, B, C, pass, or credit) in all core courses
in the semesters before and after the interventions were conducted. The graph in (b) shows the average percentage of satisfactory course
completion across all core courses in the same semesters. The error bars represent ±1 SE.

interventions helped at-risk students clear this academic
threshold, we used a logistic mixed-effect model to assess
the effect of the intervention on students’ likelihood of
satisfactory performance in each core academic class
(Bates, Maechler, & Bolker, 2012). This analysis was
restricted to at-risk students, because these students
accounted for the vast majority of postintervention course
failures. As the outcomes, we specified satisfactory course
completion (earning A, B, C, P, or CR vs. D, F, NC, or I)
in each core course before and after intervention; as
fixed effects, we specified intervention (dummy-coded),
time (0 = preintervention, 1 = postintervention), and their
interaction; as random intercepts, we specified each student, course, and school.
There was no effect of condition on preintervention
satisfactory course completion rates, t < 1. However, the
regression revealed a significant Time × Intervention
interaction, odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% CI = [1.04, 2.10],
Z = 2.18, p = .029. Intervention-group students were significantly more likely to earn satisfactory grades in core
academic classes after the intervention (raw mean = 49%)
compared with control-group students (raw mean =
41%), OR = 1.58, Z = 2.68, p = .007. Moreover, whereas
there was no difference in satisfactory completion rates
before and after the intervention among control-condition students (−0.4%), t < 1, students in the intervention

group showed a significant increase (+6.0%), Z = 4.38,
p < .001 (see Fig. 2). The 367 at-risk students in the intervention group took a total of 1,358 core courses; the
intervention thus led them to earn satisfactory grades in
87 more courses than would be expected on the basis of
control-group rates (1,358 × 6.4%).

Discussion
Are academic-mind-set interventions effective on a small
scale only with carefully managed administration? Or do
they have the potential to scale up and thereby serve as a
partial solution for pervasive underachievement in U.S.
high schools? The goal of the present research was to
answer these questions. Two interventions, each lasting
about 45 min and delivered online, raised achievement in
a large and diverse group of underperforming students
over an academic semester. Among these students, who
accounted for the bottom third of students in the sample,
the interventions raised GPA in core academic classes and
led students to earn satisfactory grades in more core
classes. Crucially, these effects were obtained across a
sample of heterogeneous schools and in response to
interventions that could be scaled to virtually unlimited
numbers of students at low marginal cost. Among the 4.93
million students who constitute the lowest-performing

third of high school students nationwide, could this translate into a proportional 1.18 million additional successfully completed courses? The results suggest this possibility.
Moreover, the methods tested here provide a feasible way
to disseminate these interventions and evaluate them on a
large scale.
A critical next step is to examine how mind-set interventions interact with diverse contexts (Hanselman,
Bruch, Gamoran, & Borman, 2014; Walton, Logel, Peach,
Spencer, & Zanna, in press). Our sample was heterogeneous, but it was nonetheless a convenience sample.
Mind-set interventions depend on resources and learning
opportunities in the academic environment: They encourage students to take advantage of such opportunities and
may be ineffective if these opportunities are absent.
Evaluating mind-set interventions with a larger and more
representative group of adolescents will help identify settings in which students’ beliefs serve as barriers to
achievement; in such settings, mind-set interventions
may be essential, but in other settings, the interventions
may have less impact. For instance, further research
might reveal settings in which mind-set interventions are
redundant with messages already present or in which
students lack access to challenging learning opportunities. In conducting this research, it will be critical to
ensure that intervention modules retain their psychological essence; mind-set interventions “are not magic . . .
they are tools to target important psychological processes
in schools” (Yeager & Walton, 2011, p. 293). If a mind-set
intervention does not speak to students’ psychological
experience, it will not be effective. More broadly, this
future research will deepen our understanding of the role
of psychological processes in the context of other factors
that shape student achievement.
It is also important to examine potential long-term
effects among high-achieving students, for whom the
benefits of mind-set interventions may not emerge until
schoolwork becomes challenging, such as when students
take advanced coursework or transition to college.

(e.g., Mueller & Dweck, 1998), and small-scale field
experiments (e.g., J. Aronson et al., 2002; Blackwell et al.,
2007). Our research simultaneously advances this lineage
and addresses an important social problem in a scalable
way.

Conclusion

1. This has also been called an incremental theory of intelligence in past research.
2. When we included all reported grades, the pattern of results
was similar to that derived from core GPA, albeit weaker. Even
so, the contrast between the three intervention conditions and
control condition remained significant (p < .05).
3. Nearly identical results for the collapsed intervention conditions were obtained using a mixed model with individual course
grade as the outcome, b = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.03, 0.25], p = .011.
Individual intervention effects using a mixed model were also
similar to those reported, .034 < ps < .054 (see Supplemental
Material available online).
4. Changes in psychological measures were not related to
changes in achievement, ts < 1.50, a pattern in keeping with the

In recent years, psychologists have called for a new
emphasis on testing the replicability of psychological
research (Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012) and on examining real-world behavioral outcomes (Schneider, Gruman,
& Coutts, 2011). In demonstrating the potential for academic-mind-set interventions to be effective on a wide
scale, the present research provides a case study of the
health of our field and its relevance to public concerns.
The interventions we tested draw directly from an intellectual lineage in psychology, including basic theory (e.g.,
Dweck & Leggett, 1988), careful laboratory experiments

1982).
5. A second possibility is that the two interventions, even though
they differed in substantive ways, shared a common underlying
ingredient and were therefore partly redundant. Indeed, each
provided a reason to work hard in school for students who
lacked such a reason. The lack of manipulation-check effects
in the combined condition does not suggest this interpretation;
however, other measures of beliefs/motivation could suggest
such a common ingredient.
