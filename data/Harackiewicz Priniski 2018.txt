Many theoretically based interventions have been developed over the past
two decades to improve educational outcomes in higher education. Based
in social-psychological and motivation theories, well-crafted interventions
have proven remarkably effective because they target specific educational
problems and the processes that underlie them. In this review, we evaluate
the current state of the literature on targeted interventions in higher education with an eye to emerging theoretical and conceptual questions about
intervention science. We review three types of interventions, which focus
on the value students perceive in academic tasks, their framing of academic
challenges, and their personal values, respectively. We consider interventions that (a) target academic outcomes (e.g., grades, major or career plans,
course taking, retention) in higher education, as well as the pipeline to college, and (b) have been evaluated in at least two studies. Finally, we discuss
implications for intervention science moving forward.

INTRODUCTION
Many theoretically based interventions have been developed over the past two decades to improve educational outcomes in higher education, and there has been great interest and excitement
about the potential of these brief and cost-effective interventions to address important societal
issues (Wilson 2011). Researchers have found that targeted interventions can have powerful and
long-lasting effects when they address specific motivational processes at crucial time points in
the educational process. Some have called these targeted interventions motivation interventions
(Lazowski & Hulleman 2016) or social-psychological interventions (Wilson 2006, Yeager & Walton 2011), reflecting their theoretical grounding. Walton (2014) has referred to them as wise
interventions because they are theoretically precise and address basic psychological processes that
can interfere with optimal academic functioning. Indeed, these three labels all capture a critical
feature of targeted interventions—a basis in theory that identifies the most powerful levers of
change in academic settings. The theories that underlie these interventions take into account the
context, the person, and person × context interactions to address real-world problems and are
thus inherently social psychological. We refer to these social-psychological interventions as targeted because they target a specific problem, the psychological process underlying the problem,
the students who should benefit from intervention, and the specific academic outcomes that should
reveal those benefits.
Targeted interventions address specific educational problems, such as closing achievement
gaps for underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) students; promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career pursuit among women; increasing interest and
engagement in gateway science courses; or helping first-year students cope with the college transition. With a well-defined problem, interventions can target the psychological processes most

Conceptual model of targeted interventions.

relevant to the problem. Students can struggle in college or lose motivation in fields of study for
many reasons. They may lack a strong preparatory background for college or financial resources,
and we would not expect social-psychological interventions to address these structural factors.
However, students may also struggle for more psychological reasons: They may lack interest in
certain topics and become disengaged in classes, or they may lack confidence in their abilities.
They may experience identity threat in certain fields and wonder if an academic discipline is right
for them, or they may doubt whether they belong in college. They may experience a cultural
mismatch between institutional norms and their own values. All of these psychological processes
are critical for academic outcomes, and all can be targeted by social-psychological interventions.
In addition to identifying the specific problem targeted by an intervention, it is important to
consider the implications for measurement of academic outcomes. Some interventions focus on
promoting motivation and performance in particular courses, where measures would thus be course
specific, such as engagement, interest, and course grades. Others focus on promoting motivation in
a field or broader domain, such as STEM fields or engineering, in which case the outcome measures
would be field specific, such as course taking, retention in those fields, or interest in a discipline.
Many interventions are even more general, targeting academic adjustment and performance in
college, in which case the outcome measures would be college general, such as college adjustment
and fit, overall grade point average (GPA), and graduation rate. The primary outcomes targeted
by an intervention serve as a measure of intervention efficacy, but they can also trigger positive
recursive processes that drive longer-term impacts. For example, if a student gets a good grade in
a critical gateway science course, they may become more interested in the field, take more science
courses, and eventually pursue a STEM career. Figure 1 shows our conceptual model.

THREE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS
In this review, we consider a wide range of targeted interventions that have been tested in higher
education and distinguish between three types of intervention: those that focus on how students
perceive value in academic tasks (task value interventions), those that change the way students
frame academic challenges (framing interventions), and those that focus on students’ personal
values (personal values interventions). These interventions are all student-centered and share
some core features: All convey some information hypothesized to affect a psychological process
and engage the student in a process of active reflection that often involves conversation or writing.
There are important differences, however, in their domain specificity and the behaviors, thought
processes, and academic outcomes they target. In short, the primary difference is in where they
focus students’ attention and reflection.
Task value interventions focus on the task at hand, which can be defined as a specific topic in
a class or a field of study, but the emphasis is always on academic content. These interventions
communicate the value or importance of the content, either by providing examples of the relevance
or usefulness of academic tasks for personal goals or by encouraging students to think about task

value for themselves through writing exercises. For example, in a utility-value intervention (a type
of task value intervention) implemented in a college biology class, students wrote about how course
topics were relevant to their own lives or useful for themselves or others (Harackiewicz et al. 2016a).
In a communal utility-value intervention, Brown et al. (2015) provided students with information
about how biomedical research could address communal goals (helping others, working with
others). Such task value interventions focus on how students perceive their coursework or fields of
study, which can then be connected with personal goals through a process of reflection. Because
of their task specificity, these interventions may be most relevant for stimulating engagement and
performance in specific courses or promoting interest in particular fields.
Framing interventions focus on the challenges that students may face during academic transitions and help students cope with adversity by framing challenges as common and improvable.
They include a broad range of interventions designed to address a variety of common concerns,
such as doubts about belonging, doubts about ability, or group-specific challenges (e.g., coming
to college as a URM student), by helping students adopt a more adaptive outlook or mindset. For
example, Walton & Cohen’s (2007) social belonging intervention provided statistics and quotes
from more senior students illustrating the fact that challenges of adjustment to college are common and can be overcome. These interventions focus on influencing how students think about
challenges, whereas task value interventions focus on the task at hand. Framing interventions
may be most relevant for promoting adjustment during critical academic transitions, such as the
transition to college, and for academic performance at a general level across courses or domains.
Personal values interventions focus on students’ core values. Like framing interventions, these
interventions center on the student, but they work more indirectly by reinforcing personal values
rather than the academic tasks at hand. For example, in their seminal values affirmation intervention with middle school students, Cohen and colleagues (2006) asked students to choose their
most important values from a list and then write about why those values were important to them.
The same intervention has been used in college physics classes (Miyake et al. 2010). These values are broad (e.g., friends and family, independence, sense of humor), and writing about them
reinforces a student’s sense of identity and self-worth, providing a buffer against threats so that
they can cope with adversity in college. As such, this may be the most general of the three types
of intervention considered in this review, and personal values interventions may be particularly
relevant for promoting academic adjustment and performance at a general level, across courses or
domains and over time.

SCOPE OF REVIEW
In this review, we consider interventions that (a) target academic outcomes (e.g., grades, major or
career plans, course taking, retention) in higher education, as well as the pipeline to college, and
(b) have been evaluated in at least two studies.1 Those that meet our criteria are summarized in
Tables 1–3. Many of the interventions covered in this review have also been tested in middle school
or high school contexts, but because we focus on interventions that target educational issues in
college, we focus our review on experimental studies conducted in college and university settings

Several other promising interventions have not (yet) been tested in multiple studies and are therefore not included: Acee &
Weinstein’s (2010) and Yeager and colleagues’ (2014) task value interventions; Landau and colleagues’ (2014), Jamieson and
colleagues’ (2016), and Browman & Destin’s (2016) framing interventions; and Kizilcec and colleagues’ (2017) intervention,
which is a hybrid of task value and personal values interventions. In addition, two studies in our review also contain tests of
interventions not (yet) tested in multiple studies: Yeager and colleagues’ (2016) critical feedback and cultural fit interventions
and Walton and colleagues’ (2015) affirmation training intervention are not included in this review.

tested in higher education contexts (e.g., Cohen et al. 2006, Hulleman & Harackiewicz 2009) or if
the intervention was implemented in high school with a follow-up in college (e.g., Harackiewicz
et al. 2012, Yeager et al. 2016).
The intervention studies we review are diverse. They range in scope from small-scale
field studies, with interventions administered in labs or single classes, to large-scale field trials. Some interventions were integrated into classes, but others were administered outside of
classes, in prematriculation activities, special orientation projects, or laboratory studies. We
focus on the context and sample for the research, the educational problem targeted, the
specific intervention tested, and the outcome measures assessed, examining whether targeted

choices.
Our goal is to assess the state of the intervention research literature, with an eye to theoretical
and conceptual questions about intervention science more generally. What makes these interventions so powerful? How replicable are the effects obtained to date? When possible, we evaluate
evidence for targeted intervention processes, i.e., whether the researchers identified processes
that help us understand how the intervention works and whether they tested for mediation

summarizes the interventions that have been tested in each category of this classification system, as well as
the number of experimental studies conducted (in parentheses).

of intervention effects. In addition, we consider whether intervention effects extended across
contexts or over time through recursive processes. Figure 2 shows our classification system, the
specific interventions tested, and the number of experimental studies evaluated in each category.

TASK VALUE INTERVENTIONS
Of the task value interventions reviewed in this article, the utility-value intervention is supported
by the highest number of randomized controlled trials (Harackiewicz et al. 2016b, Tibbetts et al.
2016b). This intervention is grounded in Eccles and colleagues’ (Eccles et al. 1983, Eccles &
Wigfield 2002) expectancy value model, which posits that the most proximal predictors of achievement and achievement-related choices (e.g., which courses to take, how hard to study for an exam)
are students’ expectations that they can succeed and the extent to which they value the task or
topic. Thus, the students who are most likely to struggle in a given course are those with low
expectations of success (due to either a history of poor performance or a lack of confidence) and
those who do not see the value in what they are learning. The hypothesis driving the utility-value
intervention is that if educators can help their students find value in the course material, this
will give students a reason, and thus the motivation, to engage with the material and ultimately
improve their performance. Specifically, the intervention targets utility value, the value perceived
in a task or topic as a result of its usefulness for achieving short- or long-term goals. For example,
students might perceive utility value in a physiology course because they can use what they learn
to make their workouts safer and more effective.
There are two basic strategies by which educators can promote perceptions of value: They
can tell students that course topics are useful and important (i.e., educators communicate value
directly), or they can task their students with discovering that value for themselves (i.e., students
generate value), most often through a writing exercise in which students relate course topics
to their own lives (Canning & Harackiewicz 2015, Durik et al. 2015, Gaspard et al. 2015).
Both strategies were tested first with several laboratory studies and then in the field, although
self-generated utility-value interventions are more common in the field (for a review, see
Harackiewicz & Hulleman 2010, Harackiewicz et al. 2014b). Because these interventions target

value in particular content, most are course-level interventions. However, it is important to note
that engaging students with the content of a course also engages them with the content of that
field. This is one avenue by which these seemingly granular, content-focused interventions could
have far-reaching consequences, such as impacting students’ educational and career choices.

Course-Specific Task Value Interventions

The course-specific task value interventions tested to date have been self-generated utility-value
interventions. In a prototypical self-generated utility-value intervention, students complete a series
of course writing assignments in which they choose a topic covered in the current unit of the
course and either discuss the relevance and utility value of the topic (the intervention condition)
or summarize the topic (the control condition). This intervention provides students opportunities
to make concrete connections between what they are learning and things that they care about,
fostering perceptions of value as well as engagement with the course content. The first field test
of this intervention was in high school science classes (Hulleman & Harackiewicz 2009). The
utility-value intervention was particularly effective for students with low expectations of success,
improving their grades in the science course and increasing their interest in science more broadly.
Since this initial high school study, the intervention has been tested in a variety of college courses,
with promising results.
Hulleman et al. (2010) administered a utility-value intervention twice during the second half
of the semester in one large section of a college introductory psychology course. Among students
who performed poorly on early exams, the utility-value intervention increased interest in the field
of psychology, as well as intention to major in psychology. Furthermore, Hulleman and colleagues
found that the mechanism driving these effects was the targeted process of perceived utility value.
In other words, for students who were initially struggling, the intervention increased perceptions
of value for the material they were learning, which, in turn, increased their interest in the field
and their intention to major in psychology.
Another study, conducted in two large sections of an introductory psychology course, found that
the utility-value intervention increased final exam scores and interest in psychology for all students
on average and for students who performed poorly on initial exams in particular (Hulleman et al.
2017). In addition, they found that the utility-value intervention had the strongest positive effects
for the students who were most at risk in this context, males who performed poorly on initial
exams. They examined intervention mechanisms and found that, for students with low grades on
early exams, the intervention increased their confidence (i.e., performance expectations) and that
this confidence, in turn, explained higher final exam grades.
Hulleman and colleagues’ (2010, 2017) work in large introductory psychology courses demonstrates that the utility-value intervention can be effective for struggling students, including groups
of students who tend to underperform. This raises the possibility that the utility-value intervention can address achievement gaps. Harackiewicz and colleagues (2016a) tested this possibility
with a large-scale field trial in eight sections of an introductory biology course for STEM majors
(over four semesters). Their approach was novel in two ways. First, they used an intersectional
analysis to examine achievement gaps for first-generation (FG) college students (i.e., those for
whom neither parent has a four-year college degree) and URM students, as well as students at
the intersection of these groups, who are both FG and URM (FG-URM). Second, they examined
students’ motivational profiles to understand the characteristics of different groups that might
influence their receptivity to the intervention.
Harackiewicz and colleagues (2016a) found that FG-URM students had a unique motivational
profile: They were least confident about their background in biology and were uncertain about
their belonging in college more generally. However, they were also highly motivated to perform

well in the course and to use their education to give back to society and help others, especially
their families and communities. Harackiewicz and colleagues hypothesized that the utility-value
intervention might give FG-URM students opportunities to connect course material to their
positive motivations (i.e., their desire to use their education to help others), which could make
the intervention particularly powerful for this group. Indeed, the intervention increased grades
for all students on average and for FG-URM students in particular, reducing the achievement
gap between FG-URM and majority students by 61%. Interestingly, the intervention was also
effective for students with low prior GPAs (above and beyond the FG-URM intervention effect),
replicating prior work by Hulleman and colleagues (2010), and for any students with higher levels
of helping motives (not just FG-URM students).
Harackiewicz and colleagues (2016a) examined intervention mechanisms and found that the
intervention effect for FG-URM students was mediated by engagement. Students in the utilityvalue condition, and FG-URM students in particular, wrote longer essays, indicating that they
engaged more with the material than did students in the control condition. This engagement, in
turn, explained increases in course performance. To explore how this played out in the content
of the essays, Harackiewicz and colleagues analyzed the essays using text analysis (Pennebaker
et al. 2007). Utility-value essays contained more personal pronouns and more words related to
social relationships, especially family, which is concordant with FG-URM students’ desire to
give back to their families and communities. Furthermore, these essays contained more words
indicative of cognitive engagement and insight. This is consistent with experimental work showing
that task value interventions increase engagement and conceptual change ( Johnson & Sinatra
2013). Beigman Klebanov and colleagues (2017) analyzed these same essays using natural language
processing techniques. They found that utility-value writing was characterized by argumentative
and narrative elements, suggesting that students were both providing personal narratives and
building arguments and claims (e.g., about why biology is valuable). Together, these analyses reveal
some of the ways that writing about utility value can increase engagement and promote learning.
Canning and colleagues (2018) tested the utility-value intervention in three sections of an
introductory biology class for STEM majors but varied the number of utility-value assignments
(from zero to three) to examine the effects of intervention dosage on performance. They also
followed students to see whether they enrolled in the second course in the biology sequence
and whether they abandoned plans to major in STEM (93% of students entered the course with
plans to major in a STEM field), as measures of STEM persistence. They found that students
who received at least one utility-value assignment earned higher grades in the course, were more
likely to enroll in the second biology course, and were less likely to abandon their STEM major.
However, students assigned the maximum dosage (three assignments) earned the highest grades
and were most likely to take the next biology course, suggesting that students benefited from
multiple doses of the intervention. Moreover, the intervention’s positive effect on continuation to
the second course (a distal outcome) was mediated by grades in the first course. In other words,
students who performed better as a result of the utility-value intervention were more likely to take
another biology course, suggesting one mechanism by which a course-specific intervention can
influence field-specific outcomes through recursive processes.

Field-Specific Task Value Interventions
Many studies of course-specific task value interventions also found effects on field-level outcomes,
such as interest in the field (Hulleman et al. 2017), intention to major in the field (Hulleman et al.
2010), retention in a STEM major, or course taking in a field (Canning et al. 2018). In addition,
some task value interventions targeted field-level outcomes directly. Brown and colleagues (2015)
developed an intervention designed to promote interest in biomedical careers by helping students

perceive the value of biomedical research for achieving communal (i.e., helping-oriented) goals.
They communicated utility value directly by giving students an article that described how a research project could help others. Across three laboratory studies, they found that the communal
utility-value intervention increased students’ interest in pursuing a career in biomedical research,
relative to a control group, and that these effects were mediated by the perceived communal value
of biomedical research (Brown et al. 2015).
In an experimental field study, Harackiewicz and colleagues (2012) tested a directly communicated utility-value intervention to help parents of high school students see the value of math
and science course taking and share that value with their teens. They hypothesized that giving
parents tools (two brochures and a website) to help them talk about the importance of math and
science would influences their teens’ perceptions of value and elective course choices. Indeed,
teens whose parents received the utility-value intervention took, on average, an extra semester of
math or science in their last two years of high school, relative to a control group whose parents
did not receive the intervention.
A five-year follow-up of these students found that the intervention had also increased students’
math and science scores on college preparatory exams (i.e., the ACT) by 12 percentile points
(Rozek et al. 2017). Importantly, these short-term outcomes (course taking and ACT scores in
high school) had long-term consequences. Rozek and colleagues found indirect effects of the
intervention such that students whose parents had received the utility-value intervention took
more math and science courses in high school and earned higher ACT scores, and that these
targeted high school outcomes were predictive of students’ college STEM course taking, majors,
and career aspirations. Thus, even when an intervention is not expected to directly influence longterm outcomes—this intervention targeted parental involvement and high school course taking—
short-term intervention effects can initiate recursive processes that impact students’ long-term
trajectories.

Task Value Interventions: Summary and Discussion
Together, these studies show that task value interventions can be a powerful tool for engaging students in thinking and writing about the why of learning, giving them a platform for exploring how
their coursework can help them achieve important personal goals. A consistent pattern of results
has emerged across a variety of contexts and modes of intervention delivery; these interventions
have proven most effective for students who struggle in courses. However, there is also evidence
of main effects in almost all of these studies; in other words, some utility-value interventions have
had positive effects for all students on average (Harackiewicz et al. 2012, 2016a; Brown et al. 2015;
Canning et al. 2018; Hulleman et al. 2017), and it will be important to clarify when and why
task value interventions should work for all students versus only for those who struggle (Schwartz
et al. 2016). Careful attention has been paid in these studies to targeted motivational processes
in these studies, with evidence for mediation of intervention effects by the targeted process of
perceived utility value and other processes such as positive expectancies and engagement. Finally,
the results of Canning et al. (2018) and Rozek et al. (2017) document some recursive effects from
the targeted outcomes (course grades and high school course taking) to more distal outcomes,
illuminating important pathways for the long-term effects of utility-value interventions.
Perhaps unsurprisingly given the theoretical grounding of these interventions, they most often
focus on single courses or particular fields. Indeed, we did not find any task value interventions
targeting college-general outcomes (e.g., cumulative GPA). However, the evidence indicates that
task value interventions can increase motivation at the field level both directly, in a single-session
laboratory study (Brown et al. 2015) and a semester-long biology course (Canning et al. 2018), and

indirectly, over a span of five years, by promoting STEM course taking and test performance in
high school (Rozek et al. 2017). Furthermore, recent work (Brown et al. 2015, Harackiewicz et al.
2016a) suggests connecting specifically to helping-oriented goals might be a powerful intervention
technique (Thoman et al. 2015, 2017). In fact, Yeager and colleagues (2014) and Paunesku et al.
(2015) have developed a task value intervention for high school students that focuses students on
self-transcendent (helping-oriented) goals for learning. Like other task value interventions, the
purpose intervention has shown positive effects on grades for low-performing students. Although
there have not been enough studies testing the purpose intervention at the college level for inclusion in this review, initial work is promising. In sum, current research suggests that task value
interventions can have broad implications for educational trajectories.

FRAMING INTERVENTIONS
Framing interventions include a diverse set of interventions to counteract the maladaptive ways
students might interpret challenges. Drawing on attribution theory (Weiner 1974, Ross & Nisbett
2011), these interventions tap into processes by which students make sense of their academic
experiences. For example, a student who receives bad grades in their first semester might attribute
their poor performance to a lack of intelligence (a maladaptive attribution) or to the steep learning
curve of adjusting to college, which they will overcome in time (an adaptive attribution). Thus,
framing interventions target common maladaptive beliefs by providing students with alternate
frames. Two messages are key: that challenge is a normal or natural experience (i.e., not exclusively
attributable to an individual’s own shortcomings) and that students can exercise control over their
academic outcomes through personal growth (i.e., challenges can be overcome with effort). These
messages are particularly important in the transition to college for underrepresented students (e.g.,
URM students, FG students, women in STEM) who may experience adversity as evidence that the
college environment is unwelcoming or even discriminatory, posing major threats to their sense of
belonging (Walton 2014). Therefore, almost all of the studies in this category are college-general
interventions targeting students’ framing of challenge in the transition to college.
Early work by Wilson & Linville (1982, 1985) tested an intervention using this attributional
approach. They showed struggling first-year students statistics and interviews indicating that most
students’ grades were lower than anticipated their first semester but improved over time. Some
participants also wrote an essay explaining to high school students how initial low grades were
attributable to temporary factors (e.g., not knowing how to take college exams). Such saying-isbelieving exercises are designed to increase internalization of the intervention message by having
students convey it in their own words (often through writing) to benefit students who will face
similar challenges in the future (Aronson 1999). Across three studies, the intervention improved
students’ performance on GRE problems immediately after the intervention and improved students’ college GPAs in the following semester, although both effects were stronger for men than
for women (Wilson & Linville 1985). These strategies have informed the design of interventions
in more recent work. In fact, a research group in Canada has implemented a very similar treatment
protocol, called attributional retraining (AR), with introductory psychology students (for a review,
see Perry & Hamm 2017, Perry et al. 2014),2 and all the interventions reviewed below draw, at
least in part, on the methods developed by Wilson & Linville.

There are many studies of AR (see, e.g., Hall et al. 2007, Haynes et al. 2006, Perry et al. 2010), but we do not include
these studies in our review because they employ different methodology. AR treatment interventions have been studied with
longitudinal quasi-experimental designs with treatment not randomized at the student level, whereas all the studies included
in our review conducted randomization at the student level.

College-General Framing Interventions
Our review identified three types of framing interventions that were tested at the college-general
level and met our inclusion criteria. These interventions include social belonging interventions,
difference education interventions, and mindset interventions.

Social belonging interventions. The seminal work on the social belonging intervention was
conducted by Walton & Cohen (2007, 2011) to address achievement gaps for African American
students at a selective college. Second-semester students read statistics and quotes from more
senior students indicating that most students worry about whether they belong in college during
their first year but that these concerns lessen over time. Participants then wrote an essay about
why that would be the case, using examples from their own experiences, and recorded a video
testimonial for future students. Control activities were similar but focused on adjusting to the
physical environment in college (e.g., the architecture, weather). This intervention improved
African American students’ GPAs the semester after the intervention (Walton & Cohen 2007) as
well as their overall GPAs, measured at a postgraduation follow-up (Walton & Cohen 2011). Daily
diary measures collected in the week after the intervention revealed that, for African Americans in
the intervention condition, experiences of adversity no longer influenced their sense of belonging,
and this decoupling process mediated the intervention effects on GPA (Walton & Cohen 2011).
In addition, Walton & Cohen found that African American students in the intervention condition
reported engaging in more adaptive academic behaviors (e.g., emailing professors, spending more
time studying) in the week following the intervention (Walton & Cohen 2007) and reported
higher levels of a sense of belonging, health, and well-being in the postgraduation survey (Walton
& Cohen 2011).
Yeager and colleagues (2016) adapted this social belonging intervention so that it could be
delivered online and tested at scale to address three different goals: to increase rates of college
enrollment among charter high school students (study 1), to address persistence gaps for disadvantaged (URM and FG) students at a public flagship university (study 2), and to address
performance gaps for disadvantaged students at a highly selective private university (study 3). In
all three studies, the intervention materials conveyed the same messages as Walton & Cohen’s
(2007) belonging intervention, but the student quotes were customized for each context. The
intervention delivered during senior year at charter high schools increased the percentage of students who stayed enrolled full-time through their first year of college (32% in the control group
versus 45% in the intervention group), and this effect was mediated by a measure of students’ social
and academic involvement behaviors on campus (e.g., living on campus, using academic support
services).
In studies 2 and 3, the intervention was delivered as part of the online orientation process in
the summer before college. In study 2, the intervention increased the percentage of disadvantaged
students who stayed enrolled full-time through their first year of college (69% in the control
group versus 73% in the intervention group). This effect was mediated by a survey measure of
social and academic involvement. In study 3, the intervention increased first-year GPA among
disadvantaged students, as well as these students’ social and academic involvement behaviors (e.g.,
having a mentor, using academic support services). Together, these studies demonstrate that the
social belonging intervention can be adapted to target students’ framing of belonging concerns
across a variety of contexts, with impressive results (Yeager et al. 2016).
Difference education interventions. Stephens and colleagues (2014) developed the difference
education intervention to provide a more adaptive frame for FG college students in the transition to

college. These students are less likely to have the procedural knowledge needed to take advantage
of campus resources and less likely to feel a sense of belonging or fit in the college environment
due to a cultural mismatch between their values and institutional norms (Stephens et al. 2012). In
the difference education intervention (Stephens et al. 2014), first-year students attended a onehour panel in which a diverse group of students discussed how their backgrounds were sources of
both challenge and strength and described strategies they used to navigate challenges and become
a successful student. Participants then recorded a video testimonial for future students. Control
participants attended a similar panel, but the panelists did not discuss their backgrounds. All
students in the intervention condition reported more academic and social engagement at the end
of the first year of college, and FG students in the intervention condition earned higher first-year
GPAs than FG students in the control condition, an effect that was mediated by their increased use
of campus resources (e.g., emailing professors, attending office hours). In a follow-up study two
years later, students from the difference education intervention condition mentioned more aspects
of their background in a speech about their college experience, indicating that they retained the
intervention message and were more comfortable talking about the role of background. In addition,
FG students from the intervention condition showed higher levels of anabolic balance reactivity, a
measure of physiological striving, compared to FG students from the control condition. Stephens
and colleagues (2015) concluded that the difference education intervention initiated recursive
processes that helped FG students view their backgrounds as a source of strength and cope more
effectively with stressful tasks.
Mindset interventions. Mindset interventions are based on Dweck’s (1999) work on lay theories
of intelligence, wherein a maladaptive theory would be that intelligence cannot be changed (a fixed
mindset), whereas an adaptive theory would be that intelligence is malleable and can be increased
with effort (a growth mindset). The prototypical mindset intervention is an eight-week program to
teach middle school students about brain plasticity and how they could develop their intelligence
by exercising their brain like a muscle (e.g., Blackwell et al. 2007). Whereas this method is not
practical in college contexts, a few studies have tried to distill this message into a briefer intervention
for college students.
Aronson and colleagues (2002) developed an intervention to combat stereotype threat, with
the idea that the stereotype that African Americans have a fixed lack of intelligence could be
rendered powerless if one holds the belief that intelligence is malleable. The mindset intervention, delivered in a laboratory setting, involved a brief video explaining how researchers have
found that the brain can grow and develop new neuronal connections and a saying-is-believing
exercise. This intervention closed gaps between African American and White students’ GPAs in
the semester after the intervention, and this effect was mediated by students’ growth mindset
beliefs.
Yeager and colleagues (2016) also tested mindset interventions in studies 1 and 2 of their
social belonging research, described above. Participants read an article summarizing the scientific
research supporting the idea that intelligence is malleable and then wrote an essay expressing this
message to future students who might be struggling in school. In both studies, some students were
randomly assigned to receive both the social belonging intervention and the mindset intervention,
which allowed a test of combined intervention. In study 1, the mindset intervention had no effect on
college enrollment, and the combined intervention was no more effective than the social belonging
intervention alone. In study 2, all three interventions increased enrollment among disadvantaged
students; there were no differences in the effectiveness of the mindset intervention, the social
belonging intervention, and the combined intervention.

Field-Specific Framing Interventions

Only one study has adapted a framing intervention to address a field-specific problem: Walton and
colleagues (2015) adapted Walton and Cohen’s (2007) original social belonging intervention (a
college-general intervention) to address the gender achievement gap in an engineering program.
First-semester engineering students in the intervention condition were given statistics and quotes
from senior engineering students and wrote a letter to a future engineering student conveying the
intervention messages in their own words. Women in male-dominated engineering majors (e.g.,
mechanical engineering) who received the social belonging intervention earned higher first-year
engineering GPAs, perceived adversity as more manageable, had more friendships with their male
colleagues, and, by the second semester, were more confident that they could succeed in the field,
compared to women in the control group.

Framing Interventions: Summary and Discussion
The framing interventions reviewed above target an impressive number of educational problems,
but they share a common goal: improving students’ academic experiences by providing adaptive frames for common challenges, from belonging concerns, to beliefs about performance and
intelligence, to cultural mismatch. They can have far-reaching benefits for students’ academic
adjustment and long-term outcomes. Across a variety of contexts and modes of intervention delivery, the pattern of results indicates that these interventions have improved important academic
outcomes for students adjusting to college. The targeted populations have varied from students
struggling in school (Wilson & Linville 1982) to African American students (Aronson et al. 2002),
first-generation students (Stephens et al. 2014), women in engineering (Walton et al. 2015), and
disadvantaged students in general (Yeager et al. 2016), and this impressive diversity suggests the
great potential of the framing approach for a number of educational problems.
However, as with task value interventions, there is also some evidence of positive effects for all
students on average (Stephens et al. 2014, 2015; Yeager et al. 2016), and it will be important to
clarify when and why framing interventions work for all students. Some results are more consistent
than they first appear, once the problem is clearly defined. For example, Yeager et al. (2016) noted
that almost all students in their study 1 were either URM or FG students and, thus, predicted a
main effect for the belonging and mindset interventions. Other findings are inconsistent; Yeager
et al. (2016, study 1) failed to find an effect of the mindset intervention, and Stephens et al. (2014)
found a main effect of the difference education intervention that specifically targeted FG students.
Overall, however, the consistency of findings is impressive, and we anticipate that the pattern of
results will become increasingly clear as more work is done to replicate these findings within the
same contexts (Wilson & Linville 1985, Walton & Cohen 2011) and between contexts (Yeager
et al. 2016).
Exploration of targeted processes in these studies has focused less on the specific cognitive
processes hypothesized to drive intervention effects (with the exception of Aronson et al. 2002)
and more on the academic behaviors that students report in academic transitions. These behaviors
are typically assessed with surveys and represent adaptive behaviors such as emailing professors,
making friends, and attending office hours. Such measures capture an approach orientation consistent with a positive framing of challenge, but they vary widely across studies. It will be important
to standardize such measures so that results can be compared across studies. However, the mediation analyses reported by Stephens et al. (2014) and Yeager et al. (2016) clearly suggest that
such measures are key to understanding how framing interventions work in college transitions.
Less attention has been paid to recursive processes in the framing studies reviewed above, in part

because these studies are more recent, with less opportunity for follow-up over time. However,
there is some evidence that physical health processes may be implicated over time (Walton &
Cohen 2011, Stephens et al. 2015), and this is a promising direction. Surprisingly, scant attention
has been paid to the content and style of students’ writing in these interventions, and this might
be a missed opportunity for extending the study of these intervention dynamics. Continued exploration of targeted and recursive processes over time will be essential for understanding how
framing interventions work to improve student outcomes.

PERSONAL VALUES INTERVENTIONS
The values affirmation intervention is based in self-affirmation theory (Steele 1988), which argues
that individuals are motivated to maintain an overall sense of self-integrity. If a student experiences
identity threat in an important academic domain (e.g., a woman taking a physics test), then their
self-integrity is called into question. Self-affirmation interventions give people an opportunity
to reflect on sources of self-worth in other domains. Writing about personal values affirms selfintegrity on a broader level and thereby diminishes the negative impact of identity threats in a
particular situation. This intervention is not specific to threats in particular domains and has been
implemented in a variety of contexts (e.g., health, relationships, sports; see Cohen & Sherman
2014 for a review).
Cohen and colleagues (2006, 2009) were the first to implement this intervention in an academic
context. They found that, when three cohorts of seventh graders completed a values affirmation
exercise in class, African American students performed better and had higher overall GPAs for the
term than African American students in the control group, and that their GPAs in core courses
remained higher over two years, especially among those with lower initial GPAs. They argued
that early improvements in performance initiated recursive processes that disrupted the negative
performance trajectory observed in the control condition. Indeed, the intervention effects on
GPA in year 2 (distal outcome) were mediated by GPA in year 1 (targeted outcome). These
effects have been replicated in several middle school studies (e.g., Bowen et al. 2013, Sherman
et al. 2013, Borman et al. 2016), and more recent work at the middle school level has focused on
understanding the mediators, moderators, and boundary conditions for these effects. For example,
Shnabel and colleagues (2013) examined the values affirmation essays from the original Cohen
studies (Cohen et al. 2006) and found that all students wrote more about social belonging in the
values affirmation condition, and that this improved grades for African American students. Thus,
recent work provides strong evidence that values affirmation can have both immediate and longterm benefits for underrepresented students, but it is also important to note that there have been
some failures to replicate these findings in middle school contexts (Dee 2015, Protzko & Aronson
2016, Hanselman et al. 2017).

Course-Specific Values Affirmation Interventions
Miyake and colleagues (2010) conducted the first test of a values affirmation intervention in
college to address gender gaps in an introductory physics course. To make the values affirmation
exercise fit seamlessly in a college science course, the instructor told students that the exercise was
a chance to practice their writing skills. It was implemented as an in-class activity in the first week
of the semester and as an online homework assignment in the fourth week (just prior to the first
midterm exam). Thus, in contrast to the social belonging or difference education interventions,
the values affirmation intervention was fully integrated into the class and presented as a course

assignment. It improved women’s exam grades and scores on a standardized physics exam, reducing
achievement gaps between women and men in the course.
Harackiewicz and colleagues (2014a) implemented the values affirmation intervention in an
introductory biology course for STEM majors, using the same basic methods as Miyake et al.
(2010). However, this intervention was targeted for a different problem, the social class achievement gap between FG and continuing-generation (CG) students. FG students in the intervention
condition earned higher grades in the biology course as well as higher overall GPAs that semester,
reducing the social class achievement gap. In addition, FG students in the intervention condition
were more likely to enroll in the next course in the biology sequence. This effect was mediated
by course grades: The intervention improved FG students’ grades in the biology course, which,
in turn, increased their likelihood of continuing in biology. Together, these two studies suggest
that the values affirmation intervention can be integrated into college science classes with positive
effects.
In the Harackiewicz et al. (2016a) utility-value intervention study, discussed above, the researchers also tested a values affirmation intervention crossed with the utility-value intervention
in a 2 × 2 design. The values affirmation intervention was implemented exactly as it was by Harackiewicz et al. (2014a), but the positive effect for FG students was not replicated, and there were no
significant interactions with the utility-value intervention. The researchers discussed a number of
factors that might have accounted for this nonreplication, most notably that the social class achievement gap was larger in the semester that the Harackiewicz et al. (2014a) study was conducted.
Indeed, previous research suggests that values affirmation is more effective when achievement
gaps are larger (Hanselman et al. 2014). Another possibility is that the addition of the utility-value
intervention (which involved three more writing assignments) dampened the effects of the values
affirmation intervention. This analysis suggests that it may not work to combine different types of
writing interventions in a single semester. Although the values affirmation intervention can have
powerful effects, it is sensitive to contextual and sample differences in ways that we do not yet
fully understand. More research is needed to identify factors that moderate the effectiveness of
the values affirmation intervention in college contexts.

College-General Values Affirmation Interventions
Self-affirmation interventions are designed to combat identity threats on a broad level. When
groups are threatened by stereotypes about intelligence or ability, their identity threat is not limited
to a single course. Therefore, it is not surprising that interventions implemented in a single course
can have downstream college-general effects (e.g., on overall GPA), as was the case in Cohen
et al.’s (2009) original study and Harackiewicz and colleagues’ (2014a) study in college biology.
However, the interventions we review in this section target college-general effects as the primary
outcomes. Furthermore, like much of the more recent work on values affirmation interventions
in middle school contexts, each of these studies has a particular focus on the moderators and
mediators of intervention effects.
Whereas other work focused on demographic moderators, such as gender, social class, or race,
Layous and colleagues (2017) examined psychological moderators of values affirmation intervention effects. They noted a common theme for all the groups that have benefited from values
affirmation: threats to a sense of belonging. Thus, in a sample of primarily White undergraduates,
Layous and colleagues administered the values affirmation exercise in a laboratory setting and
tested whether the intervention would be effective for students with a low sense of belonging.
They found no effects of the intervention on a math test administered immediately after the intervention. However, when they examined students’ grades over two semesters, they found that

the values affirmation intervention improved GPAs for all students on average compared to the
control condition, and that this effect was stronger for men and for students with low levels of
belonging.
Brady and colleagues (2016) implemented the values affirmation intervention in a laboratory
study and then followed students over time. They found a positive effect on postintervention GPAs
for Latino students at a two-year follow-up, but the effect was negative for White students. In the
fourth semester after the intervention, participants returned to the lab and completed a stressful
academic task (making a list of everything they had to get done before the end of the semester),
after which they were given a blank piece of paper to write about whatever was on their mind.
Brady and colleagues analyzed these essays and found that Latino students who had received a
values affirmation intervention two years earlier showed spontaneous self-affirmations in their
writing. In other words, they focused on personal values and positive sources of worth. Furthermore, Latino students from the affirmation condition reported more confidence in their ability
to cope with all the tasks they needed to complete, compared to those in the control condition.
Brady and colleagues tested whether these spontaneous self-affirmations mediated the effects of
the intervention on confidence and GPA. They found that among Latino students, the intervention increased their tendency to self-affirm, which improved their confidence in their coping
ability, leading to better grades that semester. These results provide insight into the recursive
processes through which the values affirmation intervention influenced academic performance
over a two-year period.
Tibbetts and colleagues (2016a) conducted a follow-up study of the Harackiewicz et al. (2014a)
sample and found that the values affirmation intervention improved FG students’ overall postintervention GPAs over the course of three years. They used text analyses to investigate the mechanisms
of these long-term effects. Their analysis was grounded in cultural mismatch theory (Stephens
et al. 2012), which states that, although everyone holds both independent and interdependent
values to some degree, FG students face a mismatch because university culture places more emphasis on independence, whereas FG students have more interdependent backgrounds. Therefore,
Tibbetts and colleagues coded for both independent and interdependent writing. They found that
the effects of the values affirmation intervention on course grades, academic belonging, and overall
GPA three years later were all mediated by independent themes. In other words, for FG students,
writing about independence in their values affirmation essays led to higher grades in the biology
course, higher levels of academic belonging, and higher GPAs over a three-year period. Although
most FG students who wrote about independence also wrote about interdependent themes (95%),
it was affirming their independent values (which match the academic context) that proved most
beneficial in this context.

Values Affirmation Interventions: Summary and Discussion
Like the framing intervention studies, the values affirmation intervention studies reviewed above
targeted an impressive number of educational problems, from gender gaps in a physics course
(Miyake et al. 2010) and the social class achievement gap in a biology course (Harackiewicz et al.
2014a) to performance among students with low belonging (Layous et al. 2017). However, the
number of tests of values affirmation in college contexts is small, and the results have not been consistent (e.g., Harackiewicz et al. 2016a). This inconsistency highlights the urgency for researchers
to demonstrate how this intervention works in college contexts and for whom. Recent studies have provided insights into the psychological moderators of values affirmation interventions
(Layous et al. 2017), as well as the proximal and distal mediators of intervention effects. Work by
Tibbetts and colleagues (2016a) demonstrated that the content of the values affirmation essays

427

ARI

14 November 2017

8:28

can provide important clues about their proximal mechanisms, revealing that, for FG students
experiencing identity threat due to a cultural mismatch, the benefits of the intervention were mediated by themes of independence. Finally, Brady and colleagues’ (2016) work illuminated a more
distal mechanism, that values affirmation interventions can improve long-term outcomes through
recursive processes involving students’ propensity to self-affirm under threat.
Values affirmation interventions were first tested in middle schools, administered by teachers
in small classes. In contrast, introductory college classes are large and impersonal, and it may be
difficult to administer a personal writing exercise in this context. However, it is not clear that
the implementation of the intervention needs to be the same across contexts. Indeed, some of the
work at the college level has been implemented in laboratory settings, rather than classrooms, with
positive results (Brady et al. 2016, Layous et al. 2017). Given the recent work showing that the
content of values affirmation essays works differently for middle school minority students and FG
college students (Shnabel et al. 2013, Tibbetts et al. 2016a), it is clear that more work is needed
to understand how values affirmation works in different contexts and for different groups.

IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION SCIENCE
The studies reviewed above reveal the power of a targeted approach to intervention research
in higher education. The interventions evaluated in these studies were grounded in theory and
developed through laboratory research and small-scale field studies, culminating in the field trials
considered in this review. As we survey the progress to date, it seems clear that intervention
scientists have made great strides over the past 15 years. The interventions are well crafted and
the research methods are rigorous, with careful attention paid to intervention mechanisms and
recursive processes.
Conducting randomized controlled field trials is a complicated process. It requires close collaboration with teaching faculty or university administrators, first to adapt the intervention for
the particular context and student population and then to implement interventions in courses or
academic advising contexts. Well-powered studies require large samples (especially if the intervention is targeted to help underrepresented minority groups) such that these studies can take
years to run. The current body of intervention research in higher education spans a wide array
of problems, ranging from achievement gaps in college courses, to promoting STEM career pursuit, to facilitating transitions to college for underrepresented students. However, these studies
represent the first wave of a new science, and there were too few studies in any category of our
classification system to permit a more quantitative review. In fact, the impressive range of problems targeted by these interventions proved to be a limitation for our review—there were very
few studies targeting the same problems with comparable measures. Although there was strong
empirical support for each of the three types of intervention in general, more research is needed
to address critical questions of replication and generalizability of findings.

Replication and Beyond
Given that the interventions reviewed above are contextually specific interventions, how should
we conceptualize the question of replication? In some ways, the interventions literature represents
an ideal case for thinking about the replication issues currently facing the field—hypotheses are
straightforward and well specified (and often preregistered), and the studies are typically well
powered, but direct replication is almost never possible. What kind of precision should we expect,
and how should we think about conceptual replications and extension of interventions to different
populations? How should we interpret nonreplications?

Our review reveals impressive patterns of consistent findings for each type of intervention but
also reveals some inconsistencies across studies and some failures to replicate findings. We would
not expect each intervention to be equally effective across every implementation, of course; in
fact, the pattern of inconsistent findings may help identify areas for future research and qualify
conclusions until we have more data in hand. In the case of task value interventions, for example,
there was a consistent pattern of findings that the interventions had positive effects for students
who struggle in classes [with some internal replications across sections of courses or semesters (e.g.,
Harackiewicz et al. 2016a)], but there are inconsistencies in the mediators between studies (e.g.,
perceived values, expectancies, engagement) that raise important questions about intervention
mechanisms. In the case of framing interventions, there was a consistent pattern of findings that
framing interventions promoted positive outcomes in academic transitions, but some evidence of
nonreplication of growth mindset effects (Yeager et al. 2016, study 2). More critically, no two
studies in the framing category examined the exact same problem, making it difficult to assess
the question of direct replication [however, some studies had internal replications with multiple
cohorts (e.g., Walton & Cohen 2011)].
We found more evidence of nonreplication for values affirmation, in part because the foundational studies were conducted earlier (Cohen et al. 2006, Miyake et al. 2010), allowing more time
for replication studies to emerge. Indeed, future reviews may contend with more nonreplications
of task value and framing interventions, and we expect that the field of intervention science will
be all the better for it. As is the case with values affirmation, each replication and nonreplication
can tell us something about the intervention, its mechanisms, and the conditions under which it
is most effectively implemented. For example, replication studies in middle school have revealed
that intervention effects may be moderated by context (Hanselman et al. 2014) and by timing of
implementation (Cook et al. 2012).
In addition to questions about the replicability of intervention effects, it is important to think
about the generalizability of the mechanism. For example, values affirmation interventions were
successfully implemented to address achievement gaps for underrepresented minority students in
middle school, then for women in college physics, and then for FG students in college biology
classes. Should we expect the intervention to work the same way in all three cases? If a social
belonging intervention works for African American students in a selective university, will it work
the same way for women in engineering programs or for underrepresented students starting college
at their state university? And if a utility-value intervention promotes interest and performance for
struggling students in a psychology class, will we expect this to work in the same way that utilityvalue interventions help minority students perform better in college biology classes?
On the one hand, the theories behind these interventions provide hypotheses about general
mechanisms that should apply across contexts and populations. For example, if struggling students
in psychology and minority students in biology both fail to see any value in what they are learning, a
utility-value intervention might work for both groups. On the other hand, our application of theory
needs to be more context dependent; we might implement the intervention differently or invoke
different mechanisms for how the intervention works in particular contexts. In the Harackiewicz
et al. (2016a) study, FG minority students believed that biology was valuable (the vast majority had
biology-related majors), but they benefited from the utility-value intervention because it allowed
them to connect course content to their helping goals. This particular mechanism is likely not
generalizable to all populations. These questions become even more complicated when considering
recursive processes, which interact with natural processes in the environment (e.g., performing
well in a biology course may catch the attention of faculty, who invite the student to join their
lab, which increases the likelihood that the student will pursue a career in that field, etc.), and are
thus context dependent, at least to some degree. Thus, our theories will need to be informed and

revised by what we learn from testing interventions in multiple contexts. Moving forward, it will
be important to consider these issues as we design and evaluate intervention research.

Implementation: How and Where?

Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2018.69:409-435. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org

There are four ways that these interventions have been implemented in randomized controlled
trials: (a) in laboratory sessions, with assessment of academic outcomes (e.g., Aronson et al. 2002,
Brown et al. 2015); (b) in orientation or advising sessions outside of class (Stephens et al. 2014,
Walton et al. 2015); (c) in preorientation activities, included as part of the prematriculation process
(Yeager et al. 2016); or (d ) in classes, integrated into the class structure (e.g., Harackiewicz et al.
2016a, Miyake et al. 2010). There are methodological trade-offs associated with each mode of
delivery. Lab studies offer the greatest control and opportunity for in-depth assessment of targeted processes. For example, Brady and colleagues (2016) were able to explore self-affirmation
and recursive processes by bringing participants back into the lab two years after participating in
a laboratory-based values affirmation study. Similarly, Stephens et al. (2015) were able to collect
physiological data to examine recursive processes two years after a differences education intervention. However, any time participants are brought back to the lab for follow-up, researchers must
contend with attrition and problems of self-selection that undercut the power of randomization
at the original point of implementation. Selection bias may also apply when students are recruited
for advising or orientation sessions scheduled outside of classes. Although randomization within
these contexts allows evaluation of treatment effects within the sample, the generalizability of the
studies is unclear. In these cases, it is imperative that researchers describe recruitment procedures
and characterize their sample relative to the targeted population. The inclusion of campus-wide
control groups (e.g., Walton & Cohen 2011, Stephens et al. 2014) can be helpful in this process.
When interventions are embedded in prematriculation activities or incorporated into class
curricula, samples are more representative of the targeted population, with fewer concerns about
selection bias. However, it is essential to track whether all students complete prematriculation
and required course assignments to evaluate treatment compliance and fidelity (O’Donnell 2008,
Hulleman & Cordray 2009). Implementation in these contexts requires close collaboration with
course instructors or deans to ensure that materials are appropriate for the context and that
randomization is carried out properly. Moreover, when working in these contexts, it is important
to design control conditions that are plausible, i.e., that have pedagogical value (in the case of
course-based interventions) or make sense as prematriculation orientation activities. For example,
in control conditions of the utility-value intervention study in biology classes (Harackiewicz et al.
2016a), students were asked to write essays summarizing course material, whereas students in the
intervention condition were asked to summarize information and then explain the relevance and
utility value of that information. Thus, the intervention had pedagogical value for all students,
which could justify its inclusion in curricula. The major disadvantage of these approaches is that it
is much more difficult to examine targeted processes. There are limited opportunities to administer
questionnaires, let alone measure physiological data. Even when possible, there are risks: The more
that data collection is added to the course or orientation, the more that it will be experienced as a
research study, reducing the authenticity and potential generalizability of the findings.
Thus, all delivery methods have benefits and disadvantages. Intervention scientists must consider the goals of their study. A study that aims to test process questions is perhaps best conducted
in the laboratory. However, a study that aims to test how the intervention works in the field
will need to be embedded in the educational context (i.e., the course, prematriculation activities,
orientation, or advising sessions, depending on the intervention). Indeed, there is an important
interplay between laboratory and context-embedded studies: Interventions tested in the lab are

scaled up for field tests, which then suggest additional process questions to be tested in the lab,
so that the intervention can be refined. For example, after their analyses of values affirmation
essays from field studies, Shnabel et al. (2013) and Tibbetts et al. (2016a) returned to the lab to
manipulate writing themes to test their field-driven hypotheses.

Implementation: Who and Why?
In the range of intervention studies reviewed above, researchers have targeted different groups
of students in different contexts—women in physics classes and engineering programs, African
American students at a selective university, students who struggle on early exams in psychology
classes, etc.—as well as broader groups of students. For example, Yeager et al. (2016) targeted
disadvantaged students, defined differently in each of three studies, based on historical achievement data in each context: In study 1, all participants were either URM or FG students; in
study 2, the disadvantaged group included all African American, Latino, and FG students; in
study 3, the disadvantaged group included all African American, Latino, Native, Pacific Islander,
and FG students. Harackiewicz et al. (2012) targeted all parents and teens with their directly communicated utility-value intervention. Other researchers targeted narrower groups of students at
the intersection of two dimensions—i.e., low-performing males in psychology classes (Hulleman
et al. 2017) and FG-URM students in biology classes (Harackiewicz et al. 2016a). The dizzying
array of populations targeted in the studies reviewed above indicates how differently problems
have been conceptualized and how difficult it is to compare results across studies.
Given that targeted interventions focus on specific educational problems for particular groups
of students, it is important to consider the individual characteristics that may predispose students
to benefit from a given intervention. For example, framing and values affirmation interventions
have proven to alleviate belonging concerns, thus promoting academic performance for underrepresented students (e.g., African American students in college, women in physics) and students
with a low sense of belonging. Utility-value interventions have been powerful in improving performance for students who struggle in a class and for students with strong helping motives by
increasing their engagement with course content and helping them to connect the material to
their own lives and goals. In order to implement an intervention with maximum effectiveness, it
is important to consider the specific processes that social-psychological interventions target and
how those processes vary across different populations.
If interventions target a general process, such as belonging concerns in the transition to college,
it may be theoretically consistent to target all disadvantaged students in that context. With other
interventions, however, hypotheses may be more specific. We recommend that researchers (continue to) conduct pilot work and use focus groups (e.g., Walton et al. 2015) to assess the problem,
population, and context. This process has two major benefits. First, baseline assessment and focus
groups can help identify which type of intervention might be appropriate in a given context and
which groups might be most responsive that intervention (e.g., Harackiewicz et al. 2016a). Second,
a deeper understanding of the context will provide insight into the ways in which intervention
materials can be customized to be most resonant with students. When assessing students’ motivational profiles, it is important to remember that students’ identities overlap and intersect, with
implications for intervention. For example, an intervention that benefits women may not benefit
FG students, and FG women may have a unique set of needs that would not be well addressed by
either interventions for women or interventions for FG students (Cole 2009).
In addition to the intersectionality of demographic categories (e.g., race and gender), it may be
fruitful to consider overlap between demographic categories and psychological variables. Layous
and colleagues’ (2017) work suggests that values affirmation interventions can be effective for
www.annualreviews.org • The Science of Targeted Intervention

431

any student with belonging concerns. Does this fully explain the benefits of values affirmation for
underrepresented minorities or FG students? Likewise, interventions that target achievement gaps
may be working primarily through benefits for low performers or through other characteristics
of the group. For example, Yeager and colleagues’ (2016) definition of disadvantaged students
as groups with a history of poor performance raises the interesting possibility that the positive
effects of social belonging interventions could be indicative of positive effects for poor performers
more generally.
As a final note, we think it will be important in future work to conduct more fine-grained analyses of intervention mechanisms for different groups. Much of the work in this review investigates
mechanism in terms of psychological processes or behaviors affected by the intervention, and this
work is crucial. However, there is another, more proximal layer of mechanism that has been gaining attention in recent work. Nearly all of the interventions in this review involve some amount
of writing, and text analysis of students’ essays may offer new insights into how different groups
internalize intervention messages and what types of writing interventions have the greatest benefits for students. Indeed, work by Harackiewicz and colleagues (2016a), Beigman Klebanov and
colleagues (2017), Shnabel and colleagues (2013), and Tibbetts and colleagues (2016a) demonstrates that these words, direct from students’ pens or keyboards, can reveal underlying intervention
mechanisms.
In sum, our review suggests that targeted interventions can be powerful in improving student
outcomes in higher education. However, there are many theoretical and methodological issues
to address as we continue to build a toolbox of interventions that target critical problems in
education. We recommend that researchers and practitioners proceed with cautious optimism and
continue the arduous but crucial work of understanding how, when, and for whom motivational
interventions can improve educational outcomes.
