changes in the interlaminar signal flows in rats
are consistent with our results obtained in monkeys performing a memory task. Together, these
findings highlight the flexibility of cortical laminar circuits. Further experiments will be needed
to determine whether such flexible interlaminar
connectivity is also implemented and used in
other cortical areas for other cognitive demands.

A brief intervention aimed at buttressing college freshmen’s sense of social belonging in school was
tested in a randomized controlled trial (N = 92), and its academic and health-related consequences over
3 years are reported. The intervention aimed to lessen psychological perceptions of threat on campus
by framing social adversity as common and transient. It used subtle attitude-change strategies to lead
participants to self-generate the intervention message. The intervention was expected to be particularly
beneficial to African-American students (N = 49), a stereotyped and socially marginalized group in
academics, and less so to European-American students (N = 43). Consistent with these expectations,
over the 3-year observation period the intervention raised African Americans’ grade-point average (GPA)
relative to multiple control groups and halved the minority achievement gap. This performance boost
was mediated by the effect of the intervention on subjective construal: It prevented students from
seeing adversity on campus as an indictment of their belonging. Additionally, the intervention
improved African Americans’ self-reported health and well-being and reduced their reported number
of doctor visits 3 years postintervention. Senior-year surveys indicated no awareness among participants
of the intervention's impact. The results suggest that social belonging is a psychological lever where
targeted intervention can have broad consequences that lessen inequalities in achievement and health.

ines a psychological factor: concern about social
belonging. Social belonging—a sense of having
positive relationships with others—is a fundamental human need (4, 5). Social isolation, loneliness,
and low social status harm not only subjective
well-being (6) but also intellectual achievement
(7) and immune function and health (8–11). Even
a single instance of exclusion can undermine wellbeing (12, 13), intelligence quotient (IQ) test performance, and self-control (14).
Members of socially stigmatized groups, such
as African Americans, may be relatively more
uncertain about their social belonging in mainstream institutions like school and work (7). Because their ethnic group is often negatively
stereotyped and marginalized, they may be unsure of whether they will be fully included in
positive social relationships in these settings (2).
As the sociologist Erving Goffman wrote, “The
central feature of the stigmatized individual’s situation in life…is a question of…‘acceptance’”
(15). Uncertainty about belonging, especially when
chronic, can undermine minorities’ performance
(7, 16) and health (3, 17, 18). Social belonging
may thus constitute a psychological lever where
targeted intervention could yield broad benefits.

units (fig. S9) [paired t test, P < 0.02, n = 19 pairs;
median distances from the granular layer were 0.45
mm (source units) and 1.05 mm (target units)].
The present study demonstrated that canonical feed-forward signal flow across cortical layers
during sensory coding reverse to the feed-back
direction during memory retrieval phase, which suggests flexible recruitment of interlaminar connectivity
depending on the cognitive demands in the monkey
association cortices (Fig. 4C). We used CSD analysis to estimate cortical layers (Fig. 1, C to E, and
fig. S1), and the observed stimulus-evoked CSD
profiles were quite similar to those in the primary
sensory cortices (17, 27). For some penetrations,
we observed that the current sink positioned superficially next to the earliest-sink contact exhibited
larger peak amplitudes and much longer durations
than that of the earliest current sink. This observation
might reflect the cytoarchitectural nature of A36 as
a dysgranular cortex (28) as well as the direct inputs
to the deepest part of the superficial layer, which is
consistent with anatomical observations (29).
A recent study in the rat primary auditory cortex demonstrated that the direction of interlaminar signal flow depends on the cortical “state”:
Sensory-evoked responses were initiated in the
thalamorecipient layers and then propagated to the
superficial and deep layers, whereas in spontaneously active “up-states,” neuronal activity was
initiated in the deep layers and then propagated to
the superficial layers (27). These state-dependent

college-adjustment process. Upon arrival in a
research lab, participants read a report of the
ostensible results of a survey of more senior
students at their school. Most students, the report
indicated, had worried about whether they belonged in college during the difficult first year but
grew confident in their belonging with time. The
survey results were said to be consistent across
ethnic and gender groups. For instance, one survey respondent was quoted as saying, “Freshman
year even though I met large numbers of people, I
didn’t have a small group of close friends…I was
pretty homesick, and I had to remind myself that
making close friends takes time. Since then…I
have met people some of whom are now just as
close as my friends in high school were” (23).
Concerns about belonging were thus represented
as common at first, as temporary, and as due to
the challenging nature of the college transition.
To encourage participants to internalize the
message, several steps exploited the “sayingis-believing effect”—the tendency to endorse
messages that one has freely advocated (25). Participants were asked to write an essay describing
how their own experiences in college echoed the
experiences summarized in the survey. They
then turned their essay into a speech, which they
delivered to a video camera. These materials,
participants were told, would be shown to future
students to help ease their transition to college.
Beyond facilitating internalization, this procedure
averted the potential stigma of receiving an
intervention, because it encouraged participants
to see themselves as benefactors and not as
beneficiaries (24, 26). In the control condition,
the procedure was the same but the survey addressed topics unrelated to belonging (e.g., change
in social-political attitudes) (23). The intervention
lasted about 1 hour.
Few analyses were moderated by cohort (i.e.,
no more than would be expected by chance alone
and none involving the primary outcomes of
GPA, health, or well-being). Thus, data from the
two cohorts were combined to increase statistical

power. First, analyses examined the trajectory of
students’ official GPA over time. In contrast to all
other groups, African Americans in the control
group showed no improvement in GPA from the
fall of their freshman year, the semester before
the intervention, through their sophomore, junior,
and senior years [linear trend F < 1]. By contrast,
the GPAs of intervention-treated African Americans rose over time [for linear trend, F(1,34) =
13.79, P = 0.0007; for time × condition, F(1,34) =
4.16, P = 0.049]. The GPAs of European-American
students also rose over time [F(1,29) = 6.88, P =
0.014] with no difference by condition [F < 1].
As Fig. 1 shows, the intervention set African
Americans on an upward trajectory such that the
gap between them and their European Americans
classmates closed over time. By students’ senior
year, the gap was cut by 79% (23).
Multiple regression, with student gender
controlled, tested the effect of student race and
condition (randomized control versus socialbelonging treatment) on change in GPA—mean
postintervention GPA (sophomore through senior
years) minus mean preintervention GPA (fall
term, first year) (23). There was no condition
effect on preintervention GPA for either racial
group [t values < 1] (table S1) (23). However, a
significant condition effect on change in GPA
emerged for African Americans [B = 0.30, t(65) =
2.54, P = 0.014] with no effect for European
Americans [t < 1] [race × condition B = –0.43, t(65) =
–2.41, P = 0.019]. Virtually identical results were
obtained when preintervention GPA was used as
a covariate in an analysis of postintervention
GPA [treatment effect for African Americans, B =
0.24, t(64) = 2.65, P = 0.010; treatment effect for
European Americans, t < 1; race × condition: B =
–0.31, t(64) = –2.27, P = 0.027]. The intervention
closed the minority gap in 3-year GPA (SD =
0.36) from 0.29 points in the control condition to
0.14 points in the treatment condition, a 52%
reduction.
Adding the campus-wide sample further supports treatment efficacy. An agreement with uni-

Such an intervention is reported here. Critical
to its rationale is the insight that it is people’s
subjective interpretations of the quality of their
relationships, more so than the objective number
or attributes of those relationships, that strongly
affects well-being (5, 19). The present intervention, delivered to students during the challenging
transition to college, was designed to encourage
nonthreatening interpretations of adversity. During
the transition to a new school, students can face
frequent social setbacks and feelings of isolation.
Their well-being and performance may depend, to
a great extent, on whether they construe such
experiences as evidence that they do not belong.
Because African-American students experience relatively greater uncertainty about their
belonging in school, they were expected to benefit from the intervention more than nonminority
students (7). Further if, as we intended, the intervention triggered an enduring perceptual change
in the encoding of social experience, its effects
might persist over time. Short-term effects might
compound into long-term effects through a recursive virtuous cycle, in which early performance gains assure students of their belonging in
school, which in turn improves their performance,
in a repeating feedback loop (20). Students who
feel more assured of their belonging may also
initiate more social interactions and form better
relationships on campus, facilitating their social
integration and further benefiting their wellbeing, performance, and health (21).
The intervention was delivered to two cohorts
of African-American (N = 49) and EuropeanAmerican (N = 43) students in the second semester of their first year at a selective college (22, 23).
To assess psychological responses to adversity,
we asked participants to complete daily surveys
in the first week after the intervention. To assess
their long-term sense of belonging, health, and
well-being, we asked them to complete an endof-college survey 3 years later (completion rate
78.26%) (23). At the end of this survey, participants were asked to authorize the release of their
complete college academic transcript (authorization rate 97.22%) (23).
Participating students were randomly assigned to either the belonging-treatment condition or a control condition. In cohort 1, participants
were recruited through convenience sampling; in
cohort 2, through random sampling (23). An
additional campus-wide control group was obtained by collecting the anonymized official
grade-point averages (GPAs) of all European
Americans (N = 1362) and African Americans
(N = 194) in the same class years as participants
but who did not participate in the study (23).
This group was included in secondary analyses
of GPA.
The intervention provided students with a
narrative that framed social adversity in school as
shared and short-lived (24). This message encouraged students to attribute adversity not to
fixed deficits unique to themselves or their ethnic
group but to common and transient aspects of the

REPORTS
2.99, P = 0.004]. In summary, the intervention
robbed adversity of its symbolic meaning for
African Americans, untethering their sense of
belonging from daily hardship (27). Like treated
African Americans, European Americans showed
little relationship between adversity and belonging
[for both conditions, mean within-subjects R =
–0.09; condition difference, t < 1] [race × condition: t(59) = –2.04, P = 0.046].
These results provide a window into the shift
in African-American students’ psychology caused
by the intervention. This shift benefited their
long-term performance. African Americans whose
belonging was more robust to daily adversity—
whose sense of belonging was relatively independent of their day-to-day adversity—showed
greater improvement in their 3-year postintervention GPA [R = 0.51, P = 0.001] (23). The
effect of the intervention in protecting AfricanAmericans students’ sense of belonging from daily
adversity mediated its effect on their GPA (23).
The intervention thus planted a change in social
perception that, it appears, accompanied students
long after the intervention ended to affect their
performance in college.
Three years after the intervention, at the end
of their college tenure, participants completed a
survey to assess long-term effects on psychology,
well-being, and health. Also, to assess whether
the intervention operated beneath conscious awareness, we asked participants whether they remembered the intervention from 3 years previously,
whether they thought it had affected them, and
whether they agreed with its message. On no
outcome did European Americans differ by condition [t values < 1.35, P values > 0.18]. African
Americans, however, showed consistent treatment effects. The race × condition interaction

was not always significant, indicating that the
treatment effect was not always larger for African
Americans than for European Americans. Degrees
of freedom vary because some measures were
completed only by participants in cohort 2 (23).
If the intervention lessened how much African Americans’ belonging fluctuated with adversity, and if it did so by lessening how much they
viewed campus life through the lens of race, then
intervention-treated African Americans should
(i) report greater stability and less uncertainty
about their belonging in school {less agreement
with items like, “When something bad happens, I
feel that maybe I don’t belong at [school name]”}
(7) and (ii) exhibit less cognitive accessibility of
negative racial stereotypes and self-doubt (23).
They did [self-reported belonging uncertainty,
t(36) = –2.01, P = 0.052; accessibility of negative
racial stereotypes, t(66) = –2.01, P = 0.049;
accessibility of self-doubt, t(64) = –2.64, P =
0.010] (Fig. 3) (23).
Given the importance of social belonging for
reducing stress and improving immune function
and physical health (5, 8–11, 19) and the relatively poorer health experienced by African
Americans, even those high in socioeconomic
status (3), we examined effects on health. We
assessed self-reported health, an important predictor of morbidity and mortality (28), using the
five-item general health component of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey
(23). We also asked participants how many times
they had visited the doctor in the previous 3
months (cohort 1) or 1 month (cohort 2). African
Americans reported being healthier and visiting the doctor less frequently in the treatment
condition than in the control condition [t(32) =
2.48, P = 0.019 and t(63) = –2.23, P = 0.030,

versity officials precludes the reporting of raw or
adjusted means in this sample. To honor this
agreement but present the results graphically, we
performed analyses on residual postintervention
GPA with preintervention GPA and gender controlled. Multiple regression on change in GPA
and on raw postintervention GPA with preintervention GPA included as a covariate yield virtually identical results (23). As shown in Fig. 2A,
treated African Americans had higher residual
GPA scores than did African Americans campuswide [B = 0.28, t(1620) = 3.97, P = 0.00008] and
African Americans in the randomized control group
[B = 0.24, t(1620) = 2.62, P = 0.009]. The latter
two groups did not differ [t < 1]. (Fig. 2A) (23).
Illustrating its broad impact, the intervention tripled the percentage of African Americans
earning postintervention GPAs in the top 25%
of their class, as measured by both residual and
raw postintervention GPA, and tended to reduce
the percentage of African Americans performing
in the bottom 25% of their class on both indices
(Fig. 2, B and C) (23).
What accounts for these treatment effects?
Daily surveys, collected the week after the intervention, suggest that the intervention buffered
African Americans against adversity (23). Among
untreated African Americans, feelings of belonging in school rose and fell with the degree
of adversity students reported having experienced
earlier that day and the day before. As adversity
rose, belonging fell (mean within-subjects R =
–0.45, derived from the average of individual
participants’ within-subjects correlations, after
each was subjected to a Fisher r-to-z transformation) (23). For treated African Americans,
this relationship was reduced to nil [mean withinsubjects R = 0.01], a significant reduction [t(59) =

proved the academic performance, self-reported
health, and well-being of ethnic minority students
over 3 years. The results suggest that inequality
between marginalized and nonmarginalized groups
arises not only from structural factors but also
from concern about social belonging.
This concern can be mitigated by using a
psychological remedy. The intervention provided
students a nonthreatening frame for interpreting
the daily challenges of school. By encouraging
students to adopt this message as their own, the
intervention made this message stick psychologically. Along with other recent research, this study

highlights how the impact of adversity depends
on its perceived meaning—how it is subjectively construed (24–26, 31–33). Changing subjective construal is a fruitful avenue for intervention
because many events are ambiguous and amenable to multiple interpretations. Moreover, a
change in construal can become self-reinforcing.
Students who feel confident in their belonging
may experience the social world in a way that reinforces this feeling. They may initiate more relationships and thus obtain more opportunities for
belonging and growth. Brief interventions that
shore up belonging can thus promote performance

recently, only 28% of treated African Americans
had [c2(1, N = 38) = 3.98, P = 0.046]. The race
gap in self-reported health was eliminated in the
treatment condition; interestingly, there was no
gap for doctor visits (23). Future research should
examine whether these patterns generalize to
physiological and physical indicators of health
(9) to assess the robustness of the effect beyond
self-report outcomes and to identify biological
pathways (11).
As further evidence of improved well-being,
African Americans also scored higher on the
Subjective Happiness Scale (23) [t(35) = 2.61, P =
0.013] (Fig. 4C). The happiness gap with European Americans higher than African Americans
disappeared in the treatment condition (23). The
finding of a lasting positive impact on subjective
happiness is noteworthy in light of research
showing that individual happiness is relatively
stable (6).
Participants were unaware of the intervention’s effect, suggesting that its efficacy did not
depend on conscious awareness. Most students
reported that they remembered participating in
the study 3 years earlier (79% did). But when
asked to describe “the most memorable and
important” information they had learned in the
study, few recalled the key content of the survey
they had read (8% did), and few reported that the
study had had “any” effect on their college experience (14% did) (table S3). There was no
condition difference on any of these outcomes for
African Americans [c2(1, N = 37 to 38) values <
1.40, P values > 0.20]; treated African Americans
ascribed no more effect to the study than untreated African Americans. However, indirect measures of recall and beliefs did show treatment
effects. When asked to “guess” the process of
change described in the survey they had read,
more treated than untreated African Americans
wrote that it concerned how students’ social experiences in college improve over time (50%
versus 20%) [c2(1, N = 38) = 3.79, P = 0.052].
Additionally, treated students endorsed this message. When asked to describe their own experiences, more treated than untreated African Americans
volunteered that their own social experiences in
college had improved over time (50% versus 20%)
[c2(1, N = 38) = 3.79, P = 0.052]. The subtle nature
of this intervention, with its influence occurring
outside conscious awareness (29), may contribute
to its efficacy. In some cases, conscious awareness may undo the effects of an intervention (30).
More overt interventions risk sending the stigmatizing message that the beneficiaries are seen
as in need of help. They may also cause resistance and reactance and undermine the sense of
accomplishment people take in their success (26).
This study provides an experimental, longitudinal demonstration that a brief intervention to
buttress feelings of social belonging can have
significant effects on a wide range of important
outcomes. The social-belonging intervention im-

and well-being even long after their delivery
(7, 20, 25, 31, 34).
Importantly, the effectiveness of socialpsychological interventions depends on factors
in the context. Such interventions are unlikely to
be effective in contexts without opportunities for
learning. Also, because the present intervention
works by changing people’s subjective interpretation of ambiguous events, it may be ineffective
in openly hostile environments. Lastly, whether
this intervention would work among younger or
less-select students, or students from other marginalized groups, is an important question for
future research (20, 31, 34). These qualifications noted, the results underscore the importance of social belonging and subjective construal
in contributing to social inequality and show
how this insight can inform our collective efforts
to promote equality in performance, health, and
well-being.

Direct Interaction of RNA
Polymerase II and Mediator
Required for Transcription in Vivo
Julie Soutourina,1* Sandra Wydau,1† Yves Ambroise,2 Claire Boschiero,1 Michel Werner1*
Gene transcription is highly regulated. Altered transcription can lead to cancer or developmental
diseases. Mediator, a multisubunit complex conserved among eukaryotes, is generally required
for RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. An interaction between the two complexes is known, but its
molecular nature and physiological role are unclear. We identify a direct physical interaction between
the Rpb3 Pol II subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the essential Mediator subunit, Med17.
Furthermore, we demonstrate a functional element in the Mediator–Pol II interface that is important
for genome-wide Pol II recruitment in vivo. Our findings suggest that a direct interaction between
Mediator and Pol II is generally required for transcription of class II genes in eukaryotes.

most Pol II–transcribed gene promoters for regulated gene expression (3–5). In Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Mediator is composed of 25 subunits
and is organized in four structural modules: the
tail, middle, head, and Cdk8 modules (6). A direct Mediator–Pol II interaction is indicated
by previous copurification, coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments (7–9) and by in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking (10). A model of the

microscopy (EM) at 35 Å resolution suggests
that several Pol II subunits (Rpb1, 2, 3, 6, and 11)
might contact the middle or the head of Mediator
(11). It was recently suggested that Rpb4 and
Rpb7 could also be implicated in interactions
with Mediator (12–14). However, the requirement
of a direct interaction between Mediator and Pol II
for transcription activation has not been demonstrated. Moreover, the identity of the Mediator
subunits contacting Pol II is unknown because of
the low resolution of the Mediator structure. As a
consequence, the mechanism by which Mediator
recruits Pol II is poorly understood.
To identify the subunit(s) of Mediator that
directly contact Pol II and determine the role of
these interactions in transcription regulation, we
used an in vivo photo–cross-linking approach based
on the incorporation by the cell-translation system of photo-activable analogs of methionine and
leucine in proteins [see supporting online material
(SOM) text and figs. S1 and S2] (15, 16).
Because EM results (11) suggested potential
interactions of 16 Mediator subunits belonging to
the head (Med6, 8, 11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22) and
middle (Med1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 21, 31) modules with
Rpb1, 2, 3, 6, or 11 Pol II subunits, we immunoprecipitated hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged proteins after in vivo cross-linking. Among the 80
pairwise contacts that we tested, only Myc-tagged
Rpb3 and HA-tagged Med17 cross-linked (Fig. 1).
These results demonstrate that the Rpb3 Pol II
