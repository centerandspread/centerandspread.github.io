There are many promising psychological interventions on the horizon, but there is no clear methodology
for preparing them to be scaled up. Drawing on design thinking, the present research formalizes a
methodology for redesigning and tailoring initial interventions. We test the methodology using the case
of fixed versus growth mindsets during the transition to high school. Qualitative inquiry and rapid,
iterative, randomized “A/B” experiments were conducted with ⬃3,000 participants to inform intervention revisions for this population. Next, 2 experimental evaluations showed that the revised growth
mindset intervention was an improvement over previous versions in terms of short-term proxy outcomes
(Study 1, N ⫽ 7,501), and it improved 9th grade core-course GPA and reduced D/F GPAs for lower
achieving students when delivered via the Internet under routine conditions with ⬃95% of students at 10
schools (Study 2, N ⫽ 3,676). Although the intervention could still be improved even further, the current
research provides a model for how to improve and scale interventions that begin to address pressing
educational problems. It also provides insight into how to teach a growth mindset more effectively.

One of the most promising developments in educational psychology in recent years has been the finding that self-administered
psychological interventions can initiate lasting improvements in
student achievement (Cohen & Sherman, 2014; Garcia & Cohen,
2012; Walton, 2014; Wilson, 2002; Yeager & Walton, 2011).
These interventions do not provide new instructional materials or
pedagogies. Instead, they capitalize on the insights of expert teachers (see Lepper & Woolverton, 2001; Treisman, 1992) by addressing students’ subjective construals of themselves and school—

how students view their abilities, their experiences in school, their
relationships with peers and teachers, and their learning tasks (see
Ross & Nisbett, 1991).
For instance, students can show greater motivation to learn
when they are led to construe their learning situation as one in
which they have the potential to develop their abilities (Dweck,
1999; Dweck, 2006), in which they feel psychologically safe and
connected to others (Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, & Master, 2006; Stephens, Hamedani, & Destin, 2014; Walton & Cohen, 2007), and in

DESIGN THINKING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

which putting forth effort has meaning and value (Hulleman &
Harackiewicz, 2009; Yeager et al., 2014; see Eccles & Wigfield,
2002; also see Elliot & Dweck, 2005; Lepper, Woolverton,
Mumme, & Gurtner, 1993; Stipek, 2002). Such subjective construals—and interventions or teacher practices that affect them—
can affect behavior over time because they can become selfconfirming. When students doubt their capacities in school—for
example, when they see a failed math test as evidence that they are
not a “math person”—they behave in ways that can make this true,
for example, by studying less rather than more or by avoiding
future math challenges they might learn from. By changing initial
construals and behaviors, psychological interventions can set in
motion recursive processes that alter students’ achievement into
the future (see Cohen & Sherman, 2014; Garcia & Cohen, 2012;
Walton, 2014; Yeager & Walton, 2011).
Although promising, self-administered psychological interventions have not often been tested in ways that are sufficiently
relevant for policy and practice. For example, rigorous randomized
trials have been conducted with only limited samples of students
within schools—those who could be conveniently recruited. These
studies have been extremely useful for testing of novel theoretical
claims (e.g., Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002; Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht, 2003). Some
studies have subsequently taken a step toward scale by developing
methods for delivering intervention materials to large samples via
the Internet without requiring professional development (e.g.,
Paunesku et al., 2015; Yeager et al., 2014). However, such tests are
limited in relevance for policy and practice because they did not
attempt to improve the outcomes of an entire student body or entire
subgroups of students.
There is not currently a methodology for adapting materials that
were effective in initial experiments so they can be improved and
made more effective for populations of students who are facing
particular issues at specific points in their academic lives. We seek
to develop this methodology here. To do so, we focus on students
at diverse schools but at a similar developmental stage, and who
therefore may encounter similar academic and psychological challenges and may benefit from an intervention to help them navigate
those challenges. We test whether the tradition of “design thinking,” combined with advances in psychological theory, can facilitate the development of improved intervention materials for a
given population.1
As explained later, the policy problem we address is core
academic performance of 9th graders transitioning to public high
schools in the United States and the specific intervention we
redesign is the growth mindset of intelligence intervention (also
called an incremental theory of intelligence intervention; Aronson
et al., 2002; Blackwell et al., 2007; Good et al., 2003; Paunesku et
al., 2015). The growth mindset intervention counteracts the fixed
mindset (also called an entity theory of intelligence), which is the
belief that intelligence is a fixed entity that cannot be changed with
experience and learning. The intervention teaches scientific facts
about the malleability of the brain, to show how intelligence can be
developed. It then uses writing assignments to help students internalize the messages (see the pilot study methods for detail). The
growth mindset intervention aims to increase students’ desires to
take on challenges and to enhance their persistence, by forestalling
attributions that academic struggles and setbacks mean one is “not
smart” (Blackwell et al., 2007, Study 1; see Burnette et al., 2013;

375

Yeager & Dweck, 2012). These psychological processes can result
in academic resilience.

Design Thinking and Psychological Interventions
To develop psychological interventions, expertise in theory is
crucial. But theory alone does not help a designer discover how to
connect with students facing a particular set of motivational barriers. Doing that, we believe, is easier when combining theoretical
expertise with a design-based approach (Razzouk & Shute, 2012;
also see Bryk, 2009; Yeager & Walton, 2011). Design thinking is
“problem-centered.” That is, effective design seeks to solve predictable problems for specified user groups (Kelley & Kelley,
2013; also see Bryk, 2009; Razzouk & Shute, 2012). Our hypothesis is that this problem-specific customization, guided by theory,
can increase the likelihood that an intervention will be more
effective for a predefined population.
We apply two design traditions, user-centered design and A/B
testing. Theories of user-centered design were pioneered by firms
such as IDEO (Kelley & Kelley, 2013; see Razzouk & Shute,
2012). The design process privileges the user’s subjective perspective—in the present case, 9th grade students. To do so, it often
employs qualitative research methods such as ethnographic observations of people’s mundane goal pursuit in their natural habitats
(Kelley & Kelley, 2013). User-centered design also has a bias
toward action. Designers test minimally viable products early in
the design phase in an effort to learn from users how to improve
them (see Ries, 2011). Applied to psychological intervention, this
can help prevent running a large, costly experiment with an intervention that has easily discoverable flaws. In sum, our aim was to
acquire insights about the barriers to students’ adoption of a
growth mindset during the transition to high school as quickly as
possible, using data that were readily obtainable, without waiting
for a full-scale, long-term evaluation.
User-centered design typically does not ask users what they
desire or would find compelling. Individuals may not always have
access to that information (Wilson, 2002). However, users may be
excellent reporters on what they dislike or are confused by. Thus,
user-centered designers do not often ask, “What kind of software
would you like?” Rather, they often show users prototypes and let
them say what seems wrong or right. Similarly, we did not ask
students, “What would make you adopt a growth mindset?” But we
did ask for positive and negative reactions to prototypes of growth
mindset materials. We then used those responses to formulate
changes for the next iteration.
Qualitative user-centered design can lead to novel insights, but
how would one know if those insights were actually improvements? Experimentation can help. Therefore we drew on a second
tradition, that of “A/B testing” (see, e.g., Kohavi & Longbotham,
2015). The logic is simple. Because it is easy to be wrong about
what will be persuasive to a user, rather than guess, test. We used
the methodology of low-cost, short-term, large-sample, randomassignment experiments to test revisions to intervention content.
Although each experiment may not, on its own, offer a theoretical

advance or a definitive conclusion, in the aggregate they may
improve an intervention for a population of interest.
Showing that this design process has produced intervention
materials that are more ready for scaling requires meeting at least
two conditions: (a) the redesigned intervention should be more
effective for the target population than a previous iteration when
examining short-term proxy outcomes, and (b) the redesigned
intervention should address the policy-relevant aim: namely, it
should benefit student achievement when delivered to entire populations of students within schools. Interestingly, although a great
deal has been written about best practices in design (e.g., Razzouk
& Shute, 2012), we do not know of any set of experiments that has
evaluated the end-product of a design process by collecting both
types of evidence.

Focus of the Present Investigation
As a first test case, we redesign a growth mindset of intelligence
intervention to improve it and to make it more effective for the
transition to high school (Aronson et al., 2002; Blackwell et al.,
2007; Good et al., 2003; Paunesku et al., 2015; see Dweck, 2006;
Yeager & Dweck, 2012). This is an informative case study because
(a) previous research has found that growth mindsets can predict
success across educational transitions, and previous growth mindset interventions have shown some effectiveness; (b) there is
a clearly defined psychological process model explaining how a
growth mindset relates to student performance supported by a
large amount of correlational and laboratory experimental research
(see a meta-analysis by Burnette et al., 2013), which informs
decisions about which “proxy” measures would be most useful for
shorter-term evaluations. The growth mindset is thus a good place
to start.
As noted, our defined user group was students making the
transition to high school. New 9th graders represent a large
population of students—approximately 4 million individuals
each year (Davis & Bauman, 2013). Although entering 9th
graders’ experiences can vary, there are some common challenges: high school freshmen often take more rigorous classes
than previously and their performance can affect their chances
for college; they have to form relationships with new teachers
and school staff; and they have to think more seriously about
their goals in life. Students who do not successfully complete
9th grade core courses have a dramatically lower rate of high
school graduation, and much poorer life prospects (Allensworth
& Easton, 2005). Improving the transition to high school is an
important policy objective.
Previous growth mindset interventions might be better tailored
for the transition to high school in several ways. First, past growth
mindset interventions were not designed for the specific challenges
that occur in the transition to high school. Rather they were often
written to address challenges that a learner in any context might
face, or they were aimed at middle school (Blackwell et al., 2007;
Good et al., 2003) or college (Aronson et al., 2002). Second,
interventions were not written for the vocabulary, conceptual sophistication, and interests of adolescents entering high school.
Third, when they were created, they did not have in mind arguments that might be most relevant or persuasive for 14- to 15year-olds.

Despite this potential lack of fit, prior growth mindset interventions have already shown initial effectiveness in high schools.
Paunesku et al. (2015) conducted a double-blind, randomized
experimental evaluation of a growth mindset intervention with
over 1,500 high school students via the Internet. The authors found
a significant Intervention ⫻ Prior achievement interaction, such
that lower-performing students benefitted most from the growth
mindset intervention in terms of their GPA. Lower-achievers both
may have had more room to grow (given range restriction for
higher achievers) and also may have faced greater concerns about
their academic ability (see analogous benefits for lower-achievers
in Cohen, Garcia, Purdie-Vaughns, Apfel, & Brzustoski, 2009;
Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009; Wilson & Linville, 1982; Yeager, Henderson, et al., 2014). Looking at grade improvement with
a different measure, Paunesku et al. also found that previously
low-achieving treated students were also less likely to receive “D”
and “F” grades in core classes (e.g., English, math, science). We
examine whether these results could be replicated with a redesigned intervention.

Overview of Studies
The present research, first, involved design thinking to create a
newer version of a growth mindset intervention, presented here as
a pilot study. Next, Study 1 tested whether the design process
produced growth mindset materials that were an improvement over
original materials when examining proxy outcomes, such as beliefs, goals, attributions, and challenge-seeking behavior (see
Blackwell et al., 2007 or Burnette et al., 2013 for justification).
The study required a great deal of power to detect a significant
intervention contrast because the generic intervention (called the
“original” intervention here; Paunesku et al., 2015) also taught a
growth mindset.
Note that we did not view the redesigned intervention as “final,”
as ready for universal scaling, or as representing the best possible
version of a growth mindset. Instead our goal was more modest:
we simply sought to document that a design process could create
materials that were a significant improvement relative to their
predecessor.
Study 2 tested whether we had developed a revised growth
mindset intervention that was actually effective at changing
achievement when delivered to a census of students (⬎95%) in 10
different schools across the country.2 The focal research hypothesis was an effect on core course GPA and D/F averages among
previously lower-performing students, which would replicate the
Intervention ⫻ Prior achievement interaction found by Paunesku
et al. (2015).
Study 2 was, to our knowledge, the first preregistered replication of a psychological intervention effect, the first to have data
collected and cleaned by an independent research firm, and the
first to employ a census (⬎95% response rates). Hence, it was a
rigorous test of the hypothesis.

Mindset Intervention

Method
Data. During the design phase, the goal was to learn as much
as possible, as rapidly as possible, given data that were readily
available. Thus, no intentional sampling was done and no demographic data on participants were collected. For informal qualitative data—focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and other types of
feedback— high school students were contacted through personal
connections and invited to provide feedback on a new program for
high school students.
Quantitative data—the rapid “A/B” experiments—were collected from college-aged and older adults on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Although adults are not an ideal data source for
a transition to high school intervention, the A/B experiments
required great statistical power because we were testing minor
variations. Data from Mechanical Turk provided this and allowed
us to iterate quickly. Conclusions from those tests were tempered
by the qualitative feedback from high school students. At the end
of this process, we conducted a final rapid A/B randomized experiment with high school students using the Qualtrics user panel
(not discussed further).
The “original” mindset intervention. The original intervention was the starting point for our revision. It involved three
elements. First, participants read a scientific article titled “You
Can Grow Your Intelligence,” written by researchers, used in the
Blackwell et al. (2007) experiment, and slightly revised for the
Paunesku et al. (2015) experiments. It described the idea that
the brain can get smarter the more it is challenged, like a muscle.
As scientific background for this idea, the article explained what
neurons are and how they form a network in the brain. It then
provided summaries of studies showing that animals or people
(e.g., rats, babies, or London taxi drivers) who have greater experience or learning develop denser networks of neurons in their
brains.
After reading this four-page article, participants were asked to
generate a personal example of learning and getting smarter—a
time when they used to not know something, but then they practiced and got better at it. Finally, participants were asked to author
a letter encouraging a future student who might be struggling in
school and may feel “dumb.” This is a “saying-is-believing” exercise (E. Aronson, 1999; J. Aronson et al., 2002; Walton &
Cohen, 2011; Walton, 2014).
“Saying-is-believing” is thought to be effective for several reasons. First, it is thought to make the information (in this case, about
the brain and its ability to grow) more self-relevant, which may
make it easier to recall (Bower & Gilligan, 1979; Hulleman &
Harackiewicz, 2009; Lord, 1980). Prior research has found that
students can benefit more from social-psychological intervention
materials when they author reasons why the content is relevant, as
opposed to being told why they are relevant to their own lives
(Godes, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2007). Second, by mentally
rehearsing how one should respond when struggling, it can be
easier to enact those thoughts or behaviors later (Gollwitzer,
1999). Third, when students are asked to communicate the message to someone else—and not directly asked to believe it themselves—it can feel less controlling, it can avoid implying that

377

students are deficient, and it can lead students to convince themselves of the truth of the proposition via cognitive dissonance
processes (see research on self-persuasion, Aronson, 1999; also
see Bem, 1965; Cooper & Fazio, 1984).

Procedures and Results: Revising the Mindset
Intervention
Design methodology.
User-centered design. We (a) met one-on-one with 9th graders, (b) met with groups of 2 to 10 students, and (c) piloted with
groups of 20 to 25 9th graders. In these piloting sessions we first
asked students to go through a “minimally viable” version of the
intervention (i.e., early draft revisions of the “original” materials)
as if they were receiving it as a new freshman in high school. We
then led them in guided discussions of what they disliked, what
they liked, and what was confusing. We also asked students to
summarize the content of the message back to us, under the
assumption that a person’s inaccurate summary of a message is an
indication of where the clarity could be improved. The informal
feedback was suggestive, not definitive. However, a consistent
message from the students allowed the research team to identify, in
advance, predictable failures of the message to connect or instruct,
and potential improvements worth testing.
Through this we developed insights that might seem minor
taken individually, but, in the aggregate, may be important. These
were: to include quotes from admired adults and celebrities; to
include more and more diverse writing exercises; to weave purposes for why one should grow one’s brain together with statements that one could grow one’s brain; to use bullet points instead
of paragraphs; to reduce the amount of information on each page;
to show actual data from past scientific research in figures rather
than summarize them generically (because it felt more respectful);
to change examples that appear less relevant to high school students (e.g., replacing a study about rats growing their brains with
a summary of science about teenagers’ brains), and more.
A/B testing. A series of randomized experiments tested specific variations on the mindset intervention. In each, we randomized participants to versions of a mindset intervention and assessed
changes from pre- to posttest in self-reported fixed mindsets (see
measures below in Study 1; also see Dweck, 1999). Mindset
self-reports are an imperfect measure, as will be shown in the two
studies. Yet they are informative in the sense that if mindsets are
not changed— or if they were changed in the wrong direction—
then it is reason for concern. Self-reports give the data “a chance
to object” (cf. Latour, 2005).
Two studies involved a total of 7 factors, fully crossed, testing
5 research questions across N ⫽ 3,004 participants. These factors
and their effects on self-reported fixed mindsets are summarized in
Table 1.
One question tested in both A/B experiments was whether it was
more effective to tell research participants that the growth mindset
intervention was designed to help them (a “direct” framing), versus
a framing in which participants were asked to help evaluate and
contribute content for future 9th grade students (an “indirect”
framing). Research on the “saying-is-believing” tactic (E. Aronson, 1999; J. Aronson et al., 2002; Walton & Cohen, 2011; Yeager
& Walton, 2011) and theory about “stealth” interventions more
broadly (Robinson, 2010) suggest that the latter might be more

Refutation: Some people seem to learn more quickly than others, for
example, in math. You may think, “Oh, they’re just smarter.” But you
don’t realize that they may be working really hard at it (harder than you
think).
Benefits of mindset: People with a growth mindset know that mistakes and
setbacks are opportunities to learn. They know that their brains can grow
the most when they do something difficult and make mistakes. We studied
all the 10th graders in the nation of Chile. The students who had a growth
mindset were 3 times more likely to score in the top 20% of their class.
Those with a fixed mindset were more likely to score in the bottom 20%

And these same students also showed big changes in their brain. . . . This

they become more capable of doing the things they care about. Not only

helpful, as noted above. Indeed, Table 1 shows that in both A/B
Study 1 and A/B Study 2 the direct framing led to smaller changes
in mindsets— corresponding to lower effectiveness—than indirect
framing (see rows 1 and 5 in Table 1). Thus, the indirect framing
was used throughout the revised intervention. To our knowledge
this is the first experimental test of the effectiveness of the indirect
framing in psychological interventions, even though it is often
standard practice (J. Aronson et al., 2002; Walton & Cohen, 2011;
Yeager & Walton, 2011).
The second question was: Is it more effective to present and
refute the fixed mindset view? Or is it more effective to only
teach evidence for the growth mindset view? On the one hand,
refuting the fixed mindset might more directly discredit the
problematic belief. On the other hand, it might give credence

and voice to the fixed mindset message, for instance by conveying that the fixed mindset is a reasonable perspective to hold
(perhaps even the norm), giving it an “illusion of truth”
(Skurnik, Yoon, Park, & Schwarz, 2005). This might cause
participants who hold a fixed mindset to become entrenched in
their beliefs. Consistent with the latter possibility, in A/B Study
1, refuting the fixed mindset view led to smaller changes in
mindsets— corresponding to lower effectiveness—as compared
with not doing so (see row 2 in Table 1). Furthermore, the
refutation manipulation caused participants who held a stronger
fixed mindset at baseline to show an increase in fixed mindset

That is, refuting a fixed mindset seemed to exacerbate fixed
mindset beliefs for those who already held them.

DESIGN THINKING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

Following this discovery, we wrote a more subtle and indirect
refutation of fixed mindset thinking and tested it in A/B Study 2.
The revised content encouraged participants to replace thoughts
about between-person comparisons (that person is smarter than
me) with within-person comparisons (I can become even smarter
tomorrow than I am today). This no longer caused reduced effectiveness (see row 6 in Table 1). The final version emphasized
within-person comparisons as a means to discrediting betweenperson comparisons. As an additional precaution, beyond what we
had tested, the final materials never named or defined a “fixed
mindset.”
We also tested the impact of using well-known or successful
adults as role models of a growth mindset. For instance, the
intervention conveyed the true story of Scott Forstall, who, with
his team, developed the first iPhone at Apple. Forstall used growth
mindset research to select team members who were not afraid of
failure but were ready for a challenge. It furthermore included an
audio excerpt from a speech given by First Lady Michelle Obama,
in which she summarized the basic concepts of growth mindset
research. These increased adoption of a growth mindset compared
to versions that did not include these endorsements (see Table 1).
Other elements were tested as well (see Table 1).
Guided by theory. The redesign also relied on psychological
theory. These changes, which were not subjected to A/B testing,
are summarized here. Several theoretical elements were relevant:
(a) theories about how growth mindset beliefs affect student behavior in practice; (b) theories of cultural values that may appear
to be in contrast with growth mindset messages; and (c) theories of
how best to induce internalization of attitudes among adolescents.
Emphasizing “strategies,” not just “hard work.” We were
concerned that the “original” intervention too greatly emphasized
“hard work” as the opposite of raw ability, and underemphasized
the need to change strategies or ask adults for advice on improved
strategies for learning. This is because just working harder with
ineffective strategies will not lead to increased learning. So, for
example, the revised intervention said “Sometimes people want to
learn something challenging, and they try hard. But they get stuck.
That’s when they need to try new strategies—new ways to approach the problem” (also see Yeager & Dweck, 2012). Our goal
was to remove any stigma of needing to ask for help or having to
switch one’s approach.
Addressing a culture of independence. We were concerned
that the notion that you can grow your intelligence would perhaps
be perceived as too “independent,” and threaten the more communal, interdependent values that many students might emphasize,
especially students from working class backgrounds and some
racial/ethnic minority groups (Fryberg, Covarrubias, & Burack,
2013; Stephens et al., 2014). Therefore we included more prosocial, beyond-the-self motives for adopting and using a growth
mindset (see Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009; Yeager et al.,
2014). For example, the new intervention said:
People tell us that they are excited to learn about a growth mindset
because it helps them achieve the goals that matter to them and to people
they care about. They use the mindset to learn in school so they can give
back to the community and make a difference in the world later.

Aligning norms. Adolescents may be especially likely to conform to peers (Cohen & Prinstein, 2006), and so we created a norm

379

around the use of a growth mindset (Cialdini et al., 1991). For
instance, the end of the second session said “People everywhere are
working to become smarter. They are starting to understand that
struggling and learning are what put them on a path to where they
want to go.” The intervention furthermore presented a series of stories
from older peers who endorsed the growth mindset concepts.
Harnessing reactance. We sought to use adolescent reactance, or the tendency to reject mainstream or external exhortations to change personal choices (Brehm, 1966; Erikson, 1968;
Hasebe, Nucci, & Nucci, 2004; Nucci, Killen, & Smetana, 1996),
as an asset rather than as a source of resistance to the message. We
did this by initially framing the mindset message as a reaction to
adult control. For instance, at the very beginning of the intervention adolescents read this story from an upper year student:
I hate how people put you in a box and say ‘you’re smart at this’ or
‘not smart at that.’ After this program, I realized the truth about labels:
they’re made up. . . . Now I do not let other people box me in. . . . It’s
up to me to put in the work to strengthen my brain.

Self-persuasion. The revised intervention increased the number of opportunities for participants to write their own opinions
and stories. This was believed to increase the probability that more
of the benefits of “saying-is-believing” would be achieved.

Study 1: Does a Revised Growth Mindset Intervention
Outperform a Previous Effective Intervention?
Study 1 evaluated whether the design process resulted in materials
that were an improvement over the originals. As criteria, Study 1 used
short-term measures of psychological processes that are wellestablished to follow from a growth mindset: person versus processfocused attributions for difficulty (low ability vs. strategy or effort),
performance avoidance goals (overconcern about making mistakes or
looking incompetent), and challenge-seeking behavior (Blackwell et
al., 2007; Mueller & Dweck, 1998; see Burnette et al., 2013; Dweck
& Leggett, 1988; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). Note that the goal of this
research was not to test whether any individual revision, by itself,
caused greater efficacy, but rather to investigate all of the changes, in
the aggregate, in comparison with the original intervention.

Method
Data. A total of 69 high schools in the United States and
Canada were recruited, and 7,501 9th grade students (predominately ages 14 –15) provided data during the session when dependent measures were collected (Time 2), although not all finished
the session.3 Participants were diverse: 17% were Hispanic/Latino,
6% were black/African American, 3% were Native American/
American Indian, 48% were White, non-Hispanic, 5% were Asian/
Asian American, and the rest were from another or multiple racial
groups. Forty-eight percent were female, and 53% reported that
their mothers had earned a bachelor’s degree or greater.
Procedures.
School recruitment. Schools were recruited via advertisements in prominent educational publications, through social media
3
This experiment involved a third condition of equal cell size that was
developed to test other questions. Results involving that condition will be
presented in a future report, but they are fully consistent with all of the
findings presented here.

(e.g., Twitter), and through recruitment talks to school districts or
other school administrators. Schools were informed that they
would have access to a free growth mindset intervention for their
students. Because of this recruitment strategy, all participating
students indeed received a version of a growth mindset intervention. The focal comparison was between an “original” version of a
growth mindset intervention (Paunesku et al., 2015, which was
adapted from materials in Blackwell et al., 2007), and a “revised”
version, created via the user-centered, rapid-prototyping design
process summarized above. See screenshots in Figure 1.
The original intervention. Minor revisions were made to the
original intervention to make it more parallel to the revised intervention, such as the option for the text to be read to students.
Survey sessions. In the winter of 2015, school coordinators
brought their students to the computer labs for two sessions, 1 to
4 weeks apart (researchers never visited the schools). The Time 1
session involved baseline survey items, a randomized mindset intervention, some fidelity measures, and brief demographics. Random
assignment happened in real time and was conducted by a web server,
and so all staff were blind to condition. The Time 2 session involved
a second round of content for the revised mindset intervention, and
control exercises for the original mindset condition. At the end of
session two, students completed proxy outcome measures.
Measures. In order to minimize respondent burden and increase
efficiency at scale, we used or developed 1- to 3-item self-report
measures of our focal constructs (see a discussion of “practical measurement” in Yeager & Bryk, 2015). We also developed a brief
behavioral task.
Fixed mindset. Three items at Time 1 and Time 2 assessed
fixed mindsets: “You have a certain amount of intelligence, and
you really can’t do much to change it,” “Your intelligence is
something about you that you can’t change very much,” and
“Being a “math person” or not is something that you really cannot
change. Some people are good at math and other people aren’t.”
(Response options: 1 ⫽ Strongly disagree, 2 ⫽ Disagree, 3 ⫽
Mostly disagree, 4 ⫽ Mostly agree, 5 ⫽ Agree, 6 ⫽ Strongly
agree). These were averaged into a single scale with higher values
corresponding to more fixed mindsets (␣ ⫽ .74).
Challenge-seeking: The “Make-a-Math-Worksheet” Task.
We created a novel behavioral task to assess a known behavioral
consequence of a growth mindset: challenge-seeking (Blackwell et
al., 2007; Mueller & Dweck, 1998). This task may allow for a
detection of effects for previously high-achieving students, because GPA may have a range restriction at the high end. It used
Algebra and Geometry problems obtained from the Khan Academy website and was designed to have more options than previous
measures (Mueller & Dweck, 1998) to produce a continuous
measure of challenge seeking. Participants read these instructions:
We are interested in what kinds of problems high school math students prefer to work on. On the next few pages, we would like you to
create your own math worksheet. If there is time, at the end of the
survey you will have the opportunity to answer these math problems.
On the next few pages there are problems from 4 different math
chapters. Choose between 2 and 6 problems for each chapter.

You can choose from problems that are:
Very challenging but you might learn a lot; Somewhat challenging and
you might learn a medium amount; Not very challenging and you

probably will not learn very much; Do not try to answer the math
problems. Just click on the problems you’d like to try later if there’s time.

See Figure 2. There were three topic areas (Introduction to Algebra, Advanced Algebra, and Geometry), and within each topic area
there were four “chapters” (e.g., rational and irrational numbers,
quadratic equations, etc.), and within each chapter there were six
problems, each labeled “Not very challenging,” “Somewhat challenging,” or “Very challenging” (two per type).4 Each page showed the six
problems for a given chapter and, as noted, students were instructed
to select “at least 2 and up to 6 problems” on each page.
The total number of “Very challenging” (i.e., hard) problems
chosen across the 12 pages was calculated for each student (Range:
0 –24) as was the total number of “Not very challenging” (i.e.,
easy) problems (Range: 0 –24). The final measure was the number
of easy problems minus the number of hard problems selected.
Visually, the final measure approximated a normal distribution.
Challenge-seeking: Hypothetical scenario. Participants were
presented with the following scenario, based on a measure in
Mueller and Dweck (1998):
Imagine that, later today or tomorrow, your math teacher hands out
two extra credit assignments. You get to choose which one to do. You
get the same number of points for trying either one. One choice is an
easy review—it has math problems you already know how to solve,
and you will probably get most of the answers right without having to
think very much. It takes 30 minutes. The other choice is a hard
challenge—it has math problems you don’t know how to solve, and
you will probably get most of the problems wrong, but you might
learn something new. It also takes 30 minutes. If you had to pick right
now, which would you pick?

Participants chose one of two options (1 ⫽ The easy math
assignment where I would get most problems right, 0 ⫽ The hard
math assignment where I would possibly learn something new).
Higher values corresponded to the avoidance of challenge, and so
this measure should be positively correlated with fixed mindset
and be reduced by the mindset intervention.
Fixed-trait attributions. Fixed mindset beliefs are known predictors of person-focused versus process-focused attributional
styles (e.g., Henderson & Dweck, 1990; Robins & Pals, 2002). We
adapted prior measures (Blackwell et al., 2007) to develop a
briefer assessment. Participants read this scenario: “Pretend that,
later today or tomorrow, you got a bad grade on a very important
math assignment. Honestly, if that happened, how likely would
you be to think these thoughts?” Participants then rated this fixedtrait, person-focused response “This means I’m probably not very
smart at math” and this malleable, process-focused response “I can
get a higher score next time if I find a better way to study
(reverse-scored)” (response options: 1 ⫽ Not at all likely, 2 ⫽
Slightly likely, 3 ⫽ Somewhat likely, 4 ⫽ Very likely, 5 ⫽ Extremely likely). The two items were averaged into a single composite, with higher values corresponding to more fixed-trait,
person-focused attributional responses.
4
A screening question also asked students to list what math course they
are currently taking. Supplementary analyses found results were no different when limiting the worksheet task data only to the “chapters” that
correspond to the course a student was enrolled in.

DESIGN THINKING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

version of this figure.

Performance avoidance goals. Because fixed mindset beliefs
are known to predict the goal of hiding one’s lack of knowledge
(Dweck & Leggett, 1988), we measured performance-avoidance
goals with a single item (Elliot & McGregor, 2001; performance
approach goals were not measured). Participants read “What
are your goals in school from now until the end of the year? Below,
say how much you agree or disagree with this statement. One of
my main goals for the rest of the school year is to avoid looking
stupid in my classes” (Response options: 1 ⫽ Strongly disagree,
2 ⫽ Disagree, 3 ⫽ Mostly disagree, 4 ⫽ Mostly agree, 5 ⫽ Agree,

6 ⫽ Strongly agree). Higher values correspond to greater performance avoidance goals.
Fidelity measures. To examine fidelity of implementation
across conditions, students were asked to report on distraction in
the classroom, both peers’ distraction (“Consider the students
around you . . . How many students would you say were working
carefully and quietly on this activity today?” Response options:
1 ⫽ Fewer than half of students, 2 ⫽ About half of students, 3 ⫽
Most students, 4 ⫽ Almost all students, with just a few exceptions,
5 ⫽ All students) and one’s own distraction (“How distracted were

you, personally, by other students in the room as you completed
this activity today?” Response options: 1 ⫽ Not distracted at all,
2 ⫽ Slightly distracted, 3 ⫽ Somewhat distracted, 4 ⫽ Very
distracted, 5 ⫽ Extremely distracted).
Next, participants in both conditions rated how interesting the
materials were (“For you personally, how interesting was the
activity you completed in this period today?” Response options:
1 ⫽ Not interesting at all, 2 ⫽ Slightly interesting, 3 ⫽ Somewhat
interesting, 4 ⫽ Very interesting, 5 ⫽ Extremely interesting), and
how much they learned from the materials (“How much do you
feel that you learned from the activity you completed in this period
today?” Response options: 1 ⫽ Nothing at all, 2 ⫽ A little, 3 ⫽ A
medium amount, 4 ⫽ A lot, 5 ⫽ An extreme amount).
Prior achievement. School records were not available for this
sample. Prior achievement was indexed by a composite of selfreports of typical grades and expected grades. The two items were
“Thinking about this school year and the last school year, what
grades do you usually get in core classes? By core classes, we
mean: English, math, and science. We don’t mean electives, like
P.E. or art” (Response options: 1 ⫽ Mostly Fs, 2 ⫽ Mostly Ds, 3 ⫽
Mostly Cs, 4 ⫽ Mostly Bs, 5 ⫽ Mostly As) and “Thinking about
your skills and the difficulty of your classes, how do you think
you’ll do in math in high school? (Response options: 1 ⫽ Extremely poorly, 2 ⫽ Very poorly, 3 ⫽ Somewhat poorly, 4 ⫽
Neither well nor poorly, 5 ⫽ Somewhat well, 6 ⫽ Very well, 7 ⫽
Extremely well). Items were z scored within schools and then
averaged, with higher values corresponding to higher prior
achievement (␣ ⫽ .74).
Attitudes to validate the “Make-a-Math-Worksheet” Task.
Additional self-reports were assessed at Time 1 to validate the
Time 2 challenge-seeking behaviors. These were all expected to be
correlated with challenge-seeking behavior. These were the short
grit scale (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009), the academic self-control
scale (Tsukayama, Duckworth, & Kim, 2013), a single item of
interest in math (“In your opinion, how interesting is the subject of
math in high school?” response options: 1 ⫽ Not at all interesting,
2 ⫽ Slightly interesting, 3 ⫽ Somewhat interesting, 4 ⫽ Very
interesting, 5 ⫽ Extremely interesting), and a single item of math
anxiety (“In general, how much does the subject of math in high
school make you feel nervous, worried, or full of anxiety?” Re-

sponse options: 1 ⫽ Not at all, 2 ⫽ A little, 3 ⫽ A medium amount,
4 ⫽ A lot, 5 ⫽ An extreme amount).

Results
Preliminary analyses. We tested for violations of assumptions of linear models (e.g., outliers, nonlinearity). Variables either
did not violate linearity, or when transforming or dropping outliers, significance of results were unchanged.
Correlational analyses. Before examining the impact of the
intervention, we conducted correlational tests to replicate the basic
findings from prior research on fixed versus growth mindsets.
Table 2 shows that measured fixed mindset significantly predicted
fixed-trait, person-focused attributions, r(6636) ⫽ .28, performance avoidance goals, r(6636) ⫽ .23, and hypothetically choosing easy problems over hard problems, r(6636) ⫽ .12 (all ps ⬍
.001). The sizes of these correlations correspond to the sizes in a
meta-analysis of many past studies (Burnette et al., 2013). Thus, a
fixed mindset was associated with thinking that difficulty means
you are “not smart,” with having the goal of not looking “dumb,”
and with avoiding hard problems that you might get wrong, as in
prior research (see Dweck, 2006; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Yeager
& Dweck, 2012).
Validating the “Make-a-math-worksheet” challenge-seeking
task. As shown in Table 2, the choice of a greater number of easy
problems as compared to hard problems at Time 2 was modestly
correlated with grit, self-control, prior performance, interest in
math, math anxiety measured at Time 1, 1 to 4 weeks earlier, and
all in the expected direction (all ps ⬍ .001, given large sample
size; see Table 2).
In addition, measured fixed mindset, fixed-trait attributions, and
performance avoidance goals predicted choices of more easy problems and fewer hard problems. The worksheet task behavior correlated with the single dichotomous hypothetical choice. Thus,
participants’ choices on this task appear to reflect their individual
differences in challenge-seeking tendencies.
Random assignment. Random assignment to condition was
effective. There were no differences between conditions in terms
of demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, special education, parental education) or in terms of prior achievement (all ps ⬎ .1),

DESIGN THINKING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS

despite 80% power to detect effects as small as d ⫽ .06. Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, there were no preintervention differences between conditions in terms of fixed mindset.
Fidelity. Students in the revised and original intervention conditions did not differ in terms of their ratings of their peers’
distraction during the testing session, t(6454) ⫽ 0.35, p ⫽ .72, or
in terms of their own personal distraction, t(6454) ⫽ 1.92, p ⫽ .06.
Although there was a trend toward greater distraction in the
original intervention group, this was likely a result of very large
sample size. Regardless, distraction was low for both groups (at or
below a 2 on a 5-point scale).
Next, the revised intervention was rated as more interesting,
t(6454) ⫽ 4.44, p ⬍ .001, and also as more likely to cause
participants to feel as though they learned something, t(6454) ⫽
6.25, p ⬍ .001. This means the design process was successful in
making the new intervention engaging. Yet this meant that in
Study 2 it was important to ensure that the control condition was
also interesting.
Self-reported fixed mindset. The revised mindset intervention
was more effective at reducing reports of a fixed mindset as
compared to the original mindset intervention. See Table 3. The
original mindset group showed a change score of ⌬ ⫽ ⫺0.22 scale
points (of 6), as compared with ⌬ ⫽ ⫺0.48 scale point (of 6) for
the revised mindset group. Both change scores were significant at
p ⬍ .001, and they were significantly different from one another
(see Table 2).
In moderation analyses, students who already had more of a
growth mindset at baseline changed their beliefs less, Intervention ⫻ Preintervention fixed mindset interaction, t(6687) ⫽ ⫺3.385,

Primary analyses.
The “make-a-math-worksheet” task. Our primary outcome of
interest was challenge-seeking behavior. Compared with the orig-

inal growth mindset intervention, the revised growth mindset intervention reduced the tendency to choose more easy than hard
math problems, 4.62 versus 2.42, a significant difference,
t(6884) ⫽ 8.03, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ .19 (see Table 3). This intervention
effect on behavior was not moderated by prior achievement,
t(6884) ⫽ ⫺.65, p ⫽ .52, ␤ ⫽ .01, or preintervention fixed
mindset, t(6884) ⫽ .63, p ⫽ .53, ␤ ⫽ .01, showing that the
intervention led high and low achievers alike to demonstrate
greater challenge-seeking.
It was also possible to test whether the revised growth mindset
intervention increased the overall number of challenging problems,
decreased the number of easy problems, or increased the proportion of problems chosen that were challenging. Supplementary
analyses showed that all of these intervention contrasts were also
significant, t(6884) ⫽ 3.95, p ⬍ .001, t(6884) ⫽ 8.60, p ⬍ .001,
t(6884) ⫽ 7.60, p ⬍ .001, respectively.
Secondary analyses.
Hypothetical challenge-seeking scenario. Compared with the
original mindset intervention, the revised mindset intervention
reduced the proportion of students saying they would choose the
“easy” math homework assignment versus the “hard” assignment
from 60% to 51%, logistic regression z ⫽ 7.951, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ .19.

Study 2: Does a Redesigned Intervention
Improve Grades?
In Study 1, the revised growth mindset intervention outperformed its predecessor in terms of changes in immediate selfreports and behavior. In Study 2 we examined whether this revised
intervention would improve actual grades among 9th graders just
beginning high school and replicate the effects of prior studies.
We carried out this experiment with a census (⬎95%) of students in 10 schools. In addition, instead of conducting the experiment ourselves (as in Study 1 and prior research), we contracted
a third-party research firm specializing in government-sponsored
public health surveys to collect and clean all data.
These procedural improvements have scientific value. First, in
prior research that served as the basis for the present investigation
(Paunesku et al., 2015), the average proportion of students in the
high school who completed the Time 1 session was 17%. The goal
of that research (and Study 1) was to achieve sample size, not
within-school representativeness.5 Thus, the present study may
include more of the kinds of students that may have been underrepresented in prior studies.
Next, achieving a census of students is informative for policy.
As noted at the outset, schools, districts, and states are often
interested in raising the achievement for entire schools or for entire
defined subgroups, not for groups of students whose teachers or
schools may have selected them into the experiment on the basis of
their likelihood of being affected by the intervention.
Finally, ambiguity about seemingly mundane methodological
choices is one important source of the nonreplication of psychological experiments (see, e.g., Schooler, 2014). Therefore, it is
important for replication purposes to be able to train third-party
researchers in study procedures, and have an arms-length relationship with data cleaning, which was done here.

Method
Data. Participants were a maximum of 3,676 students from a
national convenience sample of 10 schools in California, New
York, Texas, Virginia, and North Carolina. One additional school
was recruited, but validated student achievement records could not
be obtained. The schools were selected from a national sampling
frame based on the Common Core of Data, with these criteria:
public high school, 9th grade enrollment between 100 and 600
students, within the medium range for poverty indicators (e.g., free
or reduce price lunch %), and moderate representation of students
of color (Hispanic/Latino or Black/African American). Schools
selected from the sampling frame were then recruited by a third
party firm. School characteristics—for example, demographics,
achievement, and average fixed mindset score—are in Table 4.
Student participants were somewhat more diverse than Study 1:
29% were Hispanic/Latino, 17% were black/African American,
3% were Native American/American Indian, 30% were White,
non-Hispanic, 6% were Asian/Asian American, and the rest were
from another or multiple racial groups. Forty-eight percent were
female, and 52% reported that their mothers had earned a bachelor’s degree or greater.

The response rate for all eligible 9th grade students in the 10
participating schools for the Time 1 session was 96%. A total of
183 students did not enter their names accurately and were not
matched at Time 2. All of these unmatched students received
control exercises at Time 2. An additional 291 students completed
Time 1 materials but not Time 2 materials, and this did not vary by
condition (Control ⫽ 148, Intervention ⫽ 143). There were no
data exclusions. Students were retained as long as they began the
Time 1 survey, regardless of Time 2 participation or quality of
responses—that is, we estimated “intent-to-treat” (ITT) effects.
ITT effects are conservative tests of the hypothesis, they afford
greater internal validity (preventing possible differential attrition
from affecting results), and they are more policy-relevant because
they demonstrate the effect of offering an intervention, which is
what institutions can control.
Procedures. The firm collected all data directly from the
school partners, and cleaned and merged it, without influence of
researchers. Before the final dataset was delivered, the research
team preregistered the primary hypothesis and analytic approach
via the Open Science Framework (OSF). The preregistered hypothesis, a replication of Paunesku et al.’s (2015) interaction
effect, was that prior achievement, indexed by a composite of 8th
Grade GPA and test scores, would moderate mindset intervention
effects on 9th grade core course GPA and D/F averages (see:
osf.io/aerpt; deviations from the preanalysis plan are disclosed in
the Appendix).
Intervention delivery. Student participation consisted of two
one-period online sessions conducted at the school, during regular
class periods, in a school computer lab or classroom. The sessions
were 1 to 4 weeks apart, beginning in the first 10 weeks of the
school year. Sessions consisted of survey questions and the intervention or control intervention. Students were randomly assigned
by the software, in real time, to the intervention or control group.
A script was read to students by their teachers at the start of each
computer session.
Mindset Intervention. This was identical to the revised mindset intervention in Study 1.
Control activity. The control activity was designed to be parallel to the intervention activity. It, too, was framed as providing
helpful information about the transition to high school, and participants were asked to read and retain this information so as to
write their opinions and help future students. Because the revised
mindset intervention had been shown to be more interesting that
previous versions, great effort was made to make the control group
at least as interesting as the intervention.
The control activity involved the same type of graphic art (e.g.,
images of the brain, animations), as well as compelling stories
(e.g., about Phineas Gage). It taught basic information about the
brain, which might have been useful to students taking 9th grade
biology. It also provided stories from upperclassmen, reporting
their opinions about the content. The celebrity stories and quotes in
Time 2 were matched but they differed in content. For instance, in
the control activity Michelle Obama talked about the White
5
In Study 1 we were not able to estimate the % of students within each
school who participated because schools did not provide any official data
for the study. Yet using historical numbers from the common core of data
as a denominator for a subsample of schools that could be matched, the
median response rate was approximately 40%.

House’s BRAIN initiative, an investment in neuroscience. Finally,
as in the intervention, there were a number of opportunities for
interactivity; students were asked open-ended questions and they
provided their reactions.
Measures.
9th grade GPA. Final grades for the end of the first semester
of 9th grade were collected. Schools that provided grades on a
0 –100 scale were asked which level of performance corresponded
to which letter grade (A⫹ to F), and letter grades were then
converted to a 0 to 4.33 scale. Using full course names from
transcripts, researchers, blind to students’ condition or grades,
coded the courses as science, math or English (i.e., core courses)
or not. End of term grades for the core subjects were averaged.
When a student was enrolled in more than one course in a given
subject (e.g., both Algebra and Geometry), the student’s grades in
both were averaged, and then the composite was averaged into
their final grade variable.
As a second measure using the same outcome data, we created
a dichotomous variable to indicate poor performance (1 ⫽ an
average GPA of D⫹ or below, 0 ⫽ not; this dichotomization
cutpoint was preregistered: osf.io/aerpt).
Prior achievement. The 8th grade prior achievement variable
was an unweighted average of 8th Grade GPA and 8th grade state
test scores, which is standard measure in prior intervention experiments with incoming 9th graders (e.g., Yeager, Johnson, et al.,
2014). The high schools in the present study were from different
states and taught students from different feeder schools. We therefore z scored 8th Grade GPA and state test scores. Because this
removes the mean from each school, we later tested whether
adding fixed effects for school to statistical models changed results
(it did not; see Table 6).6 A small proportion was missing both
prior achievement measures and they were assigned a value of
zero; we then included a dummy-variable indicating missing data,
which increases transparency and is the prevailing recommendation in program evaluation (Puma, Olsen, Bell, & Price, 2009).
Hypothetical challenge-seeking. This measure was identical
to Study 1. The make-a-worksheet task was not administered in
this study because it was not yet developed when Study 2 was
launched.
Fixed mindset, attributions, and performance goals. These
measures were identical to Study 1.
Fidelity measures. Measures of distraction, interest, and selfreported learning were the same as Study 1.

Results
Preliminary analyses.
Random assignment. Random assignment to condition was
effective. There were no differences between conditions in terms
of demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, special education, parental education) or in terms of prior achievement within any of the 10
schools or in the full sample (all ps ⬎ .1). As shown in Table 3,
there were no preintervention differences between conditions in
terms of fixed mindset.
Fidelity. Several measures suggest high fidelity of implementation. On average, 94% of treated and control students answered
the open-ended questions at both Time 1 and 2, and this did not
differ by conditions or time. During the Time 1 session, both
treated and control students saw an average of 96% of the screens
in the intervention. Among those who completed the Time 2
session, treated students saw 99% of screens, compared with 97%
for control students. Thus, both conditions saw and responded to
their respective content to an equal (and high) extent.
Open-ended responses from students confirm that they were, in
general, processing the mindset message. Here are some examples
of student responses to the final writing prompt at Time 2, in which
they were asked to list the next steps they could take on their
growth mindset paths:
I can always tell myself that mistakes are evidence of learning. I
will always find difficult courses to take them. I’ll ask for help
when I need it.
To get a positive growth in mindset, you should always ask questions
and be curious. Don’t ever feel like there is a limit to your knowledge
and when feeling stuck, take a few deep breaths and relax. Nothing is
easy.
Step 1: Erase the phrase ‘I give up’ and all similar phrases from your
vocabulary. Step 2: Enter your hardest class of the day (math, for
example). Step 3: When presented with a brain-frying worksheet, ask
questions about what you don’t know.

Some prior research (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) used selfreported expectancies, not prior GPA, as a baseline moderator. We too
measured these (see Study 1 for measure). When added to the composite,
our moderation results were the same and slightly stronger. We did not
ultimately include this measure in our baseline composite in the main text
because we did not preregister it.

When I grow up I want to be a dentist which involves science. I am
not good at science . . . yet. So I am going to have to pay more
attention in class and be more focused and pay attention and learn in
class instead of fooling around.

Next, students across the two conditions reported no differences
in levels of distraction: own distraction, t(3438) ⫽ 0.15, p ⫽ .88;
others’ distraction, t(3438) ⫽ 0.37, p ⫽ .71. Finally, control
participants actually rated their content as more interesting, and
said that they felt like they learned more, as compared to treated
participants, t(3438) ⫽ 7.76 and 8.26, Cohen’s ds ⫽ .25 and .27,
respectively, ps ⬍ .001. This was surprising but it does not
threaten our primary inferences. Instead it points to the conservative nature of the control group. Control students received a
positive, interesting, informative experience that held their attention and exposed them to novel scientific information relevant to
their high school biology classes (e.g., the brain) that was endorsed
by influential role models (e.g., Michele Obama, LeBron James).
Self-reported fixed mindset. As an additional manipulation
check, students reported their fixed mindset beliefs. As shown in
Table 3, both the intervention and control conditions changed in
the direction of a growth mindset between Times 1 and 2 (change
score ps ⬍ .001). However, those in the intervention condition
changed much more (Control ⌬ ⫽ ⫺.17 scale points of 6, Intervention ⌬ ⫽ ⫺.55 scale points of 6). These change scores differed
significantly from each other, p ⬍ .001. Table 5 reports regressions
predicting postintervention fixed mindset as a function of condition, and shows that choices of covariates did not affect this result.

Moderator analyses in Table 5 show that previously higherachieving students, and, to a much lesser extent, students who held
more of a fixed mindset at baseline, changed more in the direction
of a growth mindset.
It is interesting that the control condition showed a significant
change in growth mindset—almost identical to the original mindset condition in Study 1. Perhaps teachers were regularly discussing growth mindset concepts, perhaps treated students behaved in
a more growth-mindset-oriented way, spilling over to control
students, or perhaps the control condition itself— by creating
strong interest in the science of the brain and making students feel
as though they learned something—implicitly taught a growth
mindset. In any of these cases, this would make the treatment
effect on grades conservative.
Primary analyses.
9th grade GPA. Our first preregistered confirmatory analysis was to examine the effects of the intervention on 9th Grade
GPA, moderated by prior achievement. In the full sample, there
was a significant Intervention ⫻ Prior Achievement interaction,

(Paunesku et al., 2015; Yeager et al., 2014; also see Wilson &
Linville, 1982, 1985). Table 6 shows that the significance of
this result did not depend on the covariates selected. Tests at ⫾1

grade points, t(3419) ⫽ 0.99, p ⫽ .33, d ⫽ .03. This may be
because higher achieving students have less room to improve,
or because they may manifest their increased growth mindset in
challenging-seeking rather than in seeking easy A’s.
Poor performance rates. In a second preregistered confirmatory analysis, we analyzed rates of poor performance (D or F
averages). This analysis mirrors past research (Cohen et al., 2009;
Paunesku et al., 2015; Wilson & Linville, 1982, 1985; Yeager,
Purdie-Vaughns, et al., 2014), and helps test the theoretically
predicted finding that the intervention is beneficial by stopping a
recursive process by which poor performance begets worse performance over time (Cohen et al., 2009; see Cohen & Sherman,
2014; Yeager & Walton, 2011).
There was a significant overall main effect of intervention on a
reduced rate of poor performance of 4 percentage points, z ⫽ 2.95,
p ⫽ .003, d ⫽ .10. Next, as with the full continuous GPA metric,
in a logistic regression predicting poor performance there was a
significant Intervention ⫻ Prior Achievement interaction, z ⫽
2.45, p ⫽ .014, ␤ ⫽ .05. At ⫺1 SD of prior achievement the
intervention effect was estimated to be 7 percentage points, z ⫽
3.80, p ⬍ .001, d ⫽ .13, whereas at ⫹1 SD there was a
nonsignificant difference of 0.7 percentage points, z ⫽ .42, p ⫽
.67, d ⫽ .01.
Secondary analyses.
Hypothetical challenge-seeking. The mindset intervention
reduced from 54% to 45% the proportion of students saying
they would choose the “easy” math homework assignment (that
they would likely get a high score on) versus the “hard”

assignment (that they might get a low score on; see Table 3).
The intervention effect on hypothetical challenge-seeking was
slightly larger for previously higher-achieving students, Intervention ⫻ Prior Achievement interaction z ⫽ 2.63, p ⫽ .008,
␤ ⫽ .05, and was not moderated by preintervention fixed
mindset, z ⫽ 1.45, p ⫽ .15, ␤ ⫽ .02. Thus, whereas lower
achieving students were more likely than high achieving students to show benefits in grades, higher achieving students were
more likely to show an impact on their challenge-seeking
choices on the hypothetical task.
Attributions and goals. The growth mindset intervention reduced fixed-trait, person-focused attributions, d ⫽ .13, and performance avoidance goals, d ⫽ .11, ps ⬍ .001 (see Table 3), unlike
some prior growth mindset intervention research, which did not
change these measures (Blackwell et al., 2007, Study 2). Thus, the
present study uses a field experiment to replicate much prior
research (Burnette et al., 2013; Dweck, 1999; Dweck, 2006; Yeager & Dweck, 2012).

General Discussion
The present research used “design thinking” to make psychological intervention materials more broadly applicable to students
who may share concerns and construals because they are undergoing similar challenges—in this case, 9th grade students entering
high school. When this was done, the revised intervention was
more effective in changing proxy outcomes such as beliefs and
short-term behaviors than previous materials (Study 1). Further-

YEAGER ET AL.

more, the intervention increased core course grades for previously
low-achieving students (Study 2).
Although we do not consider the revised version to be the final
iteration, the present research provides direct evidence of an exciting possibility: a two-session mindset program, developed
through an iterative, user-centered design process, may be administered to entire classes of 9th graders (⬎95% of students) and
begin to raise the grades of the lowest performers, while increasing
the learning-oriented attitudes and beliefs of low and high performers. This approach illustrates an important step toward taking
growth mindset and other psychological interventions to scale, and
for conducting replication studies.
At a theoretical level, it is interesting to note the parallels
between mindset interventions and expert tutors: both are strongly
focused on students’ construals (see Lepper, Woolverton, Mumme,
& Gurtner, 1993; Treisman, 1992). Working hand-in-hand with
students, expert tutors build relationships of trust with students and
then redirect their construals of academic difficulty as challenges
to be met, not evidence of fixed inability. In this sense, both expert
tutors and mindset interventions recognize the power of construalbased motivational factors in students’ learning. Future interventions might do well to capitalize further on the wealth of knowledge of expert tutors, who constitute one of the most powerful
educational interventions (Bloom, 1984).

Replication
Replication efforts are important for cumulative science
(Funder et al., 2014; Lehrer, 2010; Open Science Collaboration,
2015; Schooler, 2011, 2014; Schimmack, 2012; Simmons et al.,
2011; Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012; also see Ioannidis, 2005).
However, it would be easy for replications to take a misguided
“magic bullet” approach—that is, to assume that intervention
materials and procedural scripts that worked in one place for
one group should work in another place for another group
(Yeager & Walton, 2011). This is why Yeager and Walton
(2011) stated that experimenters “should [not] hand out the
original materials without considering whether they would convey the intended meaning” for the group in question (p. 291;
also see Wilson, Aronson, & Carlsmith, 2010).
The present research therefore followed a procedure of (a)
beginning with the original materials as a starting point, (b)
using a design methodology to increase the likelihood that they
conveyed the intended meaning in the targeted population (9th
graders), and (c) conducting well-powered randomized experiments in advance to ensure that, in fact, the materials were
appropriate and effective in the target population.
Study 2 showed that, when this was done, the revised mindset
intervention raised grades for previously low-achieving students,
when all data were collected, aggregated, and cleaned by an
independent third-party, and when all involved were blind to
experimental condition. Furthermore, the focal tests were preregistered (though see the Appendix). The present research therefore
provides a rigorous replication of Paunesku et al. (2015). This
directly addresses skepticism about whether a two-session, selfadministered psychological intervention can, under some conditions,
measurably improve the grades for previously low-performing students.

Nevertheless, the preregistered hypothesis reported here does
not advance our theory of mechanisms for psychological intervention effects. Additional analyses of the data— ones that could not
have been preregistered—will be essential for doing this and
further improving the intervention and its impact.

Divergence of Self-Reports and Behavior
One theme in the present study’s results—and a theme dating to
the original psychological interventions in education (Wilson &
Linville, 1982)—is a disconnect between self-reports and actual
behavior. On the basis of only the self-reported fixed mindset
results, we might have concluded that the intervention benefitted
high achievers more. However, on the basis of the GPA results, we
might conclude that the intervention “worked” better for students
who were lower in prior achievement. That is, self-reports and
grades showed moderation by prior performance in the opposite
directions.
What accounts for this? Two possibilities are germane. First,
grades follow a non-normal distribution that suffers from a range
restriction at the top, in part due to grade inflation. Thus higherachievers may not have room to increase their grades. But higherachievers may also be those who read material more carefully and
absorb the messages they are taught. These patterns could explain
smaller GPA effects but larger proxy outcome effects for higherachievers.
Another possibility is that high-achieving students may have
been inspired to take on more challenging work that might not
lead to higher grades but might teach them more. Indeed, the
hypothetical challenge-seeking measure supports this. For this
reason, it might have been informative to analyze scores on a
norm-referenced exam at the end of the term, as in some
intervention studies (Good et al., 2003; Hanselman, Bruch,
Gamoran, & Borman, 2014). If higher-achievers were choosing
harder tasks, their grades might have suffered, but their learning
might have improved. In the present research it was not possible
to administer a norm-referenced test due to the light-touch
nature of the intervention. In addition, curriculum was not held
constant across our diverse sample of schools.
Finally, Study 1’s development of a brief behavioral measure
of challenge seeking—the “make-a-worksheet” task—was a
methodological advance that may help avoid known problems
with using self-reports to evaluate behavioral interventions (see
Duckworth & Yeager, in press). This may make it a practical
proxy outcome in future evaluation of interventions (see Duckworth & Yeager, in press; Yeager & Bryk, 2015).

Limitations
The present research has many limitations. First, we only had
access to grades at the end of the first term of 9th grade—in some
cases, a few weeks after the intervention. It would have been
informative to collect grades over a longer period of time.
Second, we have not attempted here to understand heterogeneity
in effect sizes (cf. Hanselman et al., 2014). Building on the results
of the present study, we are now poised to carry out a systematic
examination of student, teacher, and school factors that cause
heterogeneous intervention effects. Indeed, with further revision to
the intervention materials, we are carrying out a version of Study

2 with students in a national sample of randomly selected U.S.
public high schools. The present study provides a basis for this.
Third, it is interesting that, although the revised mindset intervention was more effective at changing short-term beliefs and
behaviors than the original intervention (Study 1), the effect sizes
for grades in Study 2 do not exceed those found in past analogous
studies (e.g., Paunesku et al., 2015; Yeager, Henderson, et al.,
2014). Perhaps the present study, in reaching a census of students,
included more students who were reluctant to participate or who
may have been resistant to the intervention message. We furthermore utilized intent-to-treat analyses—including students who saw
any content at Session 1 regardless of whether they completed
Session 2. Or perhaps the present study enlisted teachers who were
less compliant with procedures than the enthusiastic early adopter
teachers recruited in past studies. With lower experimental control
and a census of students, there may be greater error variance,
resulting in lower effect sizes.
Although the mindset effect sizes may appear to be small—and
they are compared with the magnitude of student engagement
issues in U.S. schools—they conform to expectations,7 and are
nevertheless practically meaningful. Considering that 9th grade
course failure almost perfectly predicts eventual high school graduation rates (Allensworth & Easton, 2005), if the growth mindset
intervention reduces by 4 percentage points the proportion of 9th
graders who earn D/F averages, then a fully scaled and spread
version of this program could in theory prevent 100,000 high
school dropouts in the U.S. per year—while increasing the
learning-oriented behavior of many other students.

Conclusion
This research began with a simple question: is it possible to take an
existing, initially effective psychological intervention and redesign it
to improve the outcomes for a population of students undergoing a
similar life transition? Now that we have shown this is possible for
a growth mindset intervention and now that we have described a
method for doing so, it will be exciting to see how this approach can
be applied to other interventions. If they too can be improved, would
it be possible to disseminate them in such a way that would actually
reduce the large number of high school dropouts for the nation as a
whole? We look forward to investigating this.

Appendix
Deviations From Preregistered Analysis Plan
The study was preregistered before the delivery of the dataset
to the researchers by the third-party research firm (osf.io/aerpt).
However, after viewing the data but before testing for the
effects of the intervention variable, we discovered that some of
the preregistered methods were not possible to carry out. Because at this time there are no standards for preregistration in
psychological science, the research team used its best judgment
to make minor adjustments. In the end, we selected analyses
that were closest to a replication of the Intervention ⫻ Prior
achievement interaction reported by Paunesku et al. (2015)
(Paunesku et al. also report a main effect of intervention on
grades, but the primary effect that is interpreted and highlighted
in the paper is the interaction). The deviations from the preanalysis plan were as follows:
• We initially expected to exclude students on an individualized special education plan, but that variable was not
delivered to us for any schools.
• We preregistered a second way of coding prior performance: by including self-reported prior grades in the composite. However, we later discovered a meta-analysis
showing that this is inappropriate for use in tests of mod-

•

•

eration because lower-performing students show greater
bias and measurement error, making it an inappropriate
moderator, even though self-reported grades are an effective linear covariate (Kuncel, Crede, & Thomas, 2005).
We hoped to include social studies grades as a core
subject, but schools did not define which classes were
social studies and they could not be contacted to clarify,
and so we only classified math, science, and English as
core classes.
We preregistered other analyses that will be the subject
of other working papers: effects on stress (which were
described as exploratory in our preregistered plan), and
moderation of intervention effects by race/ethnicity and
gender (which were not found in Paunesku et al., 2015
and so, strictly speaking, they are not a part of the
replication reported here).
