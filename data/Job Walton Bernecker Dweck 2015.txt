Laboratory research shows that when people believe that willpower is an abundant (rather than highly
limited) resource they exhibit better self-control after demanding tasks. However, some have questioned
whether this “nonlimited” theory leads to squandering of resources and worse outcomes in everyday life
when demands on self-regulation are high. To examine this, we conducted a longitudinal study, assessing
students’ theories about willpower and tracking their self-regulation and academic performance. As
hypothesized, a nonlimited theory predicted better self-regulation (better time management and less
procrastination, unhealthy eating, and impulsive spending) for students who faced high self-regulatory
demands. Moreover, among students taking a heavy course load, those with a nonlimited theory earned
higher grades, which was mediated by less procrastination. These findings contradict the idea that a
limited theory helps people allocate their resources more effectively; instead, it is people with the
nonlimited theory who self-regulate well in the face of high demands.

high demands on self-control. Instead, we propose that an alternative belief—the belief that willpower is not easily used up and
can even be fueled by the exertion of self-control (a nonlimited
theory)—promotes more successful self-regulation and performance when people encounter challenging self-regulatory demands.

Do people’s beliefs about the nature of self-control affect their
ability to exert self-control in everyday life settings? If so, what
beliefs are most functional? One hypothesis is suggested by the
strength model of self-control (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven,
& Tice, 1998; Baumeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007). This model
proposes that self-control relies on a limited resource and that
understanding this limit helps people use this resource judiciously,
improving self-regulation especially when demands on self-control
are high (Vohs, Baumeister, & Schmeichel, 2012). In the present
research, however, we propose the opposite, namely, that this
limited-resource theory undermines people’s self-regulatory efforts and, moreover, does so especially when demands on selfcontrol are high. The belief that willpower relies on a limited
resource, we suggest, leads people to act as though their selfregulatory resources are depleted long before they reach any actual
limit in their self-regulatory capacity. As a consequence, we expect
that people with a limited-resource theory will reduce their effort
and engage in various overindulgent behaviors when they face

The Strength Model of Self-Control
Much contemporary research on self-regulation draws on the
strength model of self-control, which, as noted, posits that selfcontrol relies on a limited energy resource (Baumeister et al., 1998,
2007). According to this model, every act of self-control depletes
this resource, directly reducing the capacity to exert further selfcontrol—a phenomenon termed ego depletion. Empirical support
for this model comes from numerous laboratory experiments,
which show that, after an initial task requiring self-control, people
exhibit worse self-control on subsequent tasks than do people who
engaged in an initial undemanding task (for a meta-analysis, see
Hagger, Wood, Stiff, & Chatzisarantis, 2010).
Recent field studies extend these findings to everyday selfregulation, and appear to suggest that the same principle applies.
For instance, in an experience sampling study Hofmann, Vohs, and
Baumeister (2012) found that the more participants controlled
themselves by resisting desires the more likely they were to show
self-control failures later in the day. Similarly, research on stress
and self-regulation confirms that when people contend with stressful circumstances, such as daily hassles or academic examinations,
they tend to engage in more problematic, potentially harmful,
behaviors like eating unhealthy food, consuming alcohol, smoking, and spending excessively (Ng & Jeffery, 2003; Oaten &

Cheng, 2005; O’Connor, Jones, Conner, McMillan, & Ferguson,
2008; Steptoe, Lipsey, & Wardle, 1998). It is thus well documented that self-control often suffers when self-control demands
are high, both in laboratory and in everyday life settings.
Given the importance of self-regulation for successful goalstriving, health, and overall functioning (e.g., Moffitt et al., 2011),
identifying factors that predict better self-regulation, especially in
the face of high demands, is critical. Recent research has identified
several variables that moderate the ego depletion effect. For instance, motivational variables like incentives, expectations, and
perceptions of a task can diminish or eliminate ego depletion in
laboratory settings (Clarkson, Hirt, Jia, & Alexander, 2010; Martijn, Tenbult, Merckelbach, Dreezens, & De Vries, 2002; Muraven
& Slessareva, 2003). Most pertinent to the present research, Job,
Dweck, and Walton (2010) found that people’s lay beliefs about
willpower, so called implicit theories,1 determined whether people
showed ego depletion at all.

Implicit Theories About Willpower
Challenging the strength model of self-control, Job and colleagues (2010) demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments
that only people who believe that willpower is limited and easily
depleted (a limited theory of willpower, assessed with questions
like, “After a strenuous mental activity, your energy is depleted
and you must rest to get it refueled again”) show ego depletion,
that is, perform worse after an initial self-control task. People who
reject the view that willpower is highly constrained and who
believe, instead, that willpower can even be self-generating (e.g.,
“After a strenuous mental activity, you feel energized for further
challenging activities”) showed no impairment over a series of
demanding self-control tasks (see also Miller et al., 2012). We call
the latter belief a nonlimited theory of willpower. We intentionally
do not use the term “unlimited.” People with a nonlimited theory
may not believe that willpower is limitless or that they are immune
to depletion from highly strenuous tasks of long duration. However, they reject the view that willpower is easily depleted by acts
of self-control.
Job and colleagues found that implicit theories about willpower
predict ego depletion both measuring theories about willpower as
an individual difference and manipulating them experimentally,
suggesting their causal role. These findings imply that selfregulatory failure following the brief exertion of self-control results from people’s beliefs about their available resources rather
than from a true lack of resources (see also Job, Walton, Bernecker, & Dweck, 2013).
How do implicit theories about willpower affect ego depletion?
Research suggests that the belief that willpower is limited sensitizes people to cues that may signal the availability or unavailability of mental resources. For example, finding an initial self-control
task exhausting predicted worse subsequent self-control performance for people with a limited theory but was unpredictive for
people with a nonlimited theory (Job et al., 2010, Study 3). In
another series of studies, ingesting glucose restored self-control for
those with a limited theory but had no effect on those with a
nonlimited theory, who continued to perform well on self-control
tasks whether they had ingested glucose or not (Job et al., 2013).
Previous research suggests that glucose signals the restoration of
self-control resources (Chambers, Bridge, & Jones, 2009; Molden

et al., 2012). Our results suggest that only people who believe that
willpower is highly limited carefully monitor for cues to the
availability of self-control resources.
Extending this research, Vohs and colleagues (2012) replicated
the effects of implicit theories about willpower on ego depletion
and raised an important question: Will the same effects hold when
self-control demands are especially high? Vohs and colleagues
hypothesized that implicit theories about willpower lead people to
temporarily compensate for a lack of resources. They suggest that
people can do so effectively in the face of mild or moderate
self-control demands but not in the face of high demands, where
“severe” depletion eventually takes its toll. In a laboratory experiment,
they examined how a manipulation of theories about willpower
interacted with three ego depletion conditions: a “no depletion”
condition in which participants completed no initial self-control
tasks; a “mild depletion” condition in which participants completed two initial self-control tasks; and a “severe depletion”
condition in which participants completed four initial self-control
tasks. Vohs and colleagues replicated the finding that a nonlimited
theory of willpower improves self-control in the face of “mild
depletion.” But in the “severe depletion” condition, there was no
positive effect of a nonlimited theory and on one of two measures
of self-control performance the effect even reversed: participants
led to adopt a limited-resource theory performed better. Vohs and
colleagues concluded that a nonlimited theory can be counterproductive. Thinking that willpower is nonlimited, they write, “might
undermine the normal tendency to conserve resources (Muraven,
Shmueli, & Burkley, 2006) so that people find themselves severely
depleted after multiple tasks” (p. 186).
Laboratory tasks, however, are not ideal for drawing conclusions about the limits of willpower. There are many reasons people
might display less effort after a long series of demanding but
potentially unmeaningful tasks. The critical test of how beliefs
about willpower affect self-regulation must be conducted in realworld settings in which people contend with accumulating demands on their self-control as they strive to accomplish personal
goals. Indeed, in contrast to Vohs and colleagues’ conclusion, an
earlier longitudinal study found that college students who endorsed
a nonlimited theory of willpower exhibited superior everyday
self-regulation during the week before final exams, when demands
on self-control were assumed to be high (Job et al., 2010, Study 4).
They ate less unhealthy food, procrastinated less, and pursued
personal achievement goals more effectively than students with a
limited theory.
The present research extends this prior study to provide a more
detailed examination of how implicit theories about willpower
predict everyday self-regulation. The study does so in several
ways. First, the prior study simply assumed that self-regulatory
demands were high for all students at a particular time; that is, as
final exams approached. In the present research, we assessed the
level of self-regulatory demands for each student on a week-byweek basis across an academic term so we could identify the
students who faced consistently high demands and those who
faced lower demands. We hypothesized that a nonlimited theory of
1
Here the term “implicit” means that theories about willpower are most
often not articulated. However, we assume that people are able to recognize
their beliefs when asked to respond to items that make them explicit.

WILLPOWER-THEORIES PREDICT SELF-REGULATION AND GRADES

willpower would predict better self-regulatory outcomes among
students who contended with high self-regulatory demands but not
necessarily among students who faced low self-regulatory demands. Second, we assessed a broader range of self-regulatory
outcomes than in past research, including not only procrastination
and unhealthy eating but also ineffective time management, impulsive spending, and emotion-regulation failure. Finally, we examined a further important outcome that is determined in part by
self-regulation, and that is not self-reported: participants’ end-ofterm grade point average (GPA) (see Duckworth & Seligman,
2005). We examined whether a nonlimited theory of willpower
would predict a higher GPA that term (controlling for past GPA)
especially among students who took a heavy course load. We
further expected that any improvement in GPA would be mediated
by better self-regulation, especially lower levels of procrastination.
In summary, we tested the hypothesis that students holding a
nonlimited theory of willpower facing consistently high demands
would display better self-regulation and consequently would reach
higher grades than would students holding a limited theory facing
similar circumstances. If this is the case, it would suggest that
thinking of willpower as a nonlimited resource, rather than harming people by leading them to waste their resources, helps people
stay focused on their goals when a heavy workload and accumulating demands make self-regulation challenging.

Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants were 176 students at a selective university in the
Western United States (101 women; Mage ⫽ 21.21, SD ⫽ 2.62).
They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at five time
points, once each week during the second half of a 10-week term
(T1–T5). Students received $3 for completing each questionnaire
and a $10 bonus for completing all five questionnaires. A total of
113 participants completed all five questionnaires; 26 completed
four, 13 completed three, 10 completed two, and 14 completed
one. Data from all participants who completed at least two consecutive questionnaires were included in hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses of self-regulation (N ⫽ 156). [Participants
who completed the relevant measures versus those who did not did
not differ in theories about willpower, t(174) ⫽ ⫺.84, p ⫽ .40.]
Each week on Monday morning, participants received a link to the
online questionnaire with a request to respond that day. On average, 65% of participants completed the questionnaire that day
(ranging from 83% at T1% to 54% at T4). Nonresponding participants were sent a reminder on Tuesday and could respond until
Wednesday night.
At the beginning of the first questionnaire, participants provided
informed consent and were asked to authorize the release of their
college academic records from the term of their participation and
the prior term. One hundred fifty-three participants (87%) authorized the release. [Participants who authorized the release of their
academic record did not differ in their theories about willpower
from those who did not, t(174) ⫽ 0.23, p ⫽ .82.]

Measure of Implicit Theories About Willpower
At Time 1 participants completed a 6-item measure assessing
theories about willpower with respect to strenuous mental ex-

639

ertion (Job et al., 2010). Sample items include, “After a strenuous mental activity your energy is depleted and you must rest
to get it refueled again” (limited-resource theory) and, “Your
mental stamina fuels itself; even after strenuous mental exertion
you can continue doing more of it” (nonlimited-resource theory) (1 ⫽ strongly agree, 6 ⫽ strongly disagree; ␣ ⫽ .85).
Items referring to the limited-resource theory were reversescored so that higher values represent greater agreement with
the limited-resource theory (Mgrand ⫽ 3.88, SD ⫽ .88).

Measures of Everyday Self-Regulation Failures and
Self-Regulatory Demands
Our questionnaire allowed us to determine which students faced
high demands over a several week period. Each questionnaire
assessed, first, indices of everyday self-regulation failures during
the previous week and, second, self-regulatory demands anticipated in the current week. This approach separates the assessment
of the two critical variables for each week in order to prevent
reports of one from biasing reports of the other. Since we had no
measure of self-regulation failures during the last week of the
study, we had complete information about anticipated selfregulatory demands and self-regulation failures for four weeks.
Everyday self-regulation. Each questionnaire (T1–T5) assessed self-regulatory failures during the prior week by asking
participants to report the frequency of (a) procrastination, defined
as engaging in nonacademic activities rather than studying (e.g.,
“How often did you meet friends instead of studying?”), (b)
consumption of unhealthy (high fat/high sugar) foods and drinks,
like chocolate bars or salty snacks, (b) poor time management
(e.g., “How often did you come late to an appointment?”), (d)
excess spending (e.g., “How often did you buy something knowing
that it’s actually too expensive for you?”), and (e) failure to control
emotions, (e.g., “How often did you have trouble controlling your
temper?”) during the prior week (1 ⫽ never, 2 ⫽ 1 time per week,
3 ⫽ 2 times per week, 4 ⫽ 3– 4 times per week, 5 ⫽ 5– 6 times per
week, 6 ⫽ 1 time per day, 7 ⫽ two or more times per day).
Descriptive statistics and reliability information are presented in
Table 1.
To assess whether the five indicators of self-regulation failure
converged as indicators of a single latent variable, we conducted a
confirmatory factor analysis with full information maximum likelihood estimation on the five measures assessed at T1. A onefactor model fit the data: ␹2(df ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 176) ⫽ 3.03, p ⫽ .70,
comparative fit index (CFI) ⫽ 1.00, root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) ⫽ .00. All loadings were significant
(standardized values: procrastination ⫽ .67, consumption of unhealthy foods ⫽ .22, poor time management ⫽ .59, excess spending ⫽ .46, emotion-regulation failure ⫽ .52). Therefore, in addition to examining each measure separately, we also created a
composite index of self-regulation failure by averaging scores for
the five variables at each time point.
Anticipated self-regulatory demands. We created a list of 13
demands undergraduate students commonly face over an academic
term. These included academic tasks (e.g., “class presentations to
deliver,” “tests to take”) and social stressors (e.g., “conflicts with
one’s professor or TA,” “experience of social exclusion or rejection”). For each demand, participants were asked to “indicate how
much you will have to deal with [this] task or experience during

Academic performance and course load. Students’ college
academic records provided measures of (a) their GPA during the
term the study was conducted and the previous term, and (b) their
course load, that is, the number of units students enrolled in each
term.

Trait Self-Control
If we find the hypothesized relationship between a nonlimited
theory and fewer self-regulatory failures, a potential alternative
explanation involves trait self-control: perhaps people with a nonlimited theory about willpower show better self-regulatory outcomes simply because they have greater self-control to begin with.
To examine this possibility, we administered the brief Trait SelfControl Scale (Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone, 2004) at the end of
the T2 questionnaire. Participants indicated on a 5-point scale (1 ⫽
not at all, 5 ⫽ very much) how well each of 13 statements about
self-control described their typical behavior (e.g., “I’m good at
resisting temptation,” “I am lazy”) (␣ ⫽ .88).

Results
After reporting descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations,
the results are divided into two main sections. First, we analyzed
everyday self-regulation with a multilevel approach. Our primary
focus was on between-participants differences in self-regulatory
demands—whether students who faced high demands during the
term self-regulated better or more poorly as a function of their
implicit theory of willpower. We focused on this question because we
expected self-regulatory demands and behavior to vary more betweenthan within-participants over this relatively short time period (i.e., five
consecutive weeks within a term). However, we also examined
within-participant (i.e., week-to-week) changes in self-regulatory
demands to determine whether students showed differences in
self-regulation, as a function of their theories about willpower, on

weeks they had previously predicted would pose high versus low
demands.
Second, we examined students’ end-of-term GPA. A series of
regression analyses tested the hypothesis that theories about willpower would predict GPA, that this relationship would be moderated by academic work-load, and that it would be mediated by
procrastination.

Descriptive Statistics
Means and standard deviations of self-regulatory behaviors and
self-regulatory demands for each week are presented in Table 1.
Over the course of the five measurement times, levels of procrastination and time-management failure dropped: linear withinparticipant contrasts F(1, 93) ⫽ 16.19, p ⫽ .001 and F(1, 93) ⫽
25.32, p ⬍ .001, respectively. As the end of the term and final
exams approached, students procrastinated less and managed their
time better.
Table 2 reports the means, standard deviations, and zero-order
correlations of theories about willpower, course load in the current
term, GPA in the current and previous term, as well as trait
self-control. There were no significant zero-order correlations
among willpower theories, course load, and GPA. As expected,
current- and prior-term GPA were highly correlated and there was
no mean difference between the two, t ⬍ 1. There was also a
significant correlation between theories about willpower and trait
self-control. Participants low in trait self-control agreed more with
2
An important question concerns how self-regulatory demands change
over the course of an academic term. In past research, we theorized that
demands increase as finals week approaches (Job et al., 2010). The present
data allow a test of this assumption. This was the case for academic
demands. Specifically, participants’ ratings of how much they would have
to deal with tests increased over the four weeks as indicated by a significant
linear within-participant contrast, F(1, 128) ⫽ 59.20, p ⬍ .001. There was
no such increase for nonacademic demands; indeed, social stressors (e.g.,
social obligations) declined as the end of the term approached, F(1, 128) ⫽
5.67, p ⫽ .04. A strength of the present study is that, rather than assuming
that all students are facing high or low demands at certain times, we
assessed the level of demands each student anticipated week by week over
the second half of the term.

a limited-resource theory. As will be seen, however, this difference
did not account for the effect of theories about willpower on
self-regulation and performance.

Everyday Self-Regulation Failure and Self-Regulatory
Demands
Our data on students’ weekly self-regulation failure and selfregulatory demands conform to a two-level hierarchical structure
(repeated measures nested within individuals). Therefore, we used
hierarchical linear modeling (HLM 6.2 statistical software package, Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, Congdon, & du Toit, 2004) to
analyze between- and within-person differences in self-regulation
as our dependent variable. We first estimated an unconditional
model with no predictors at either level of the hierarchy, to see
how much variation in weekly self-regulation lay between- versus
within-participants. This analysis revealed that, as might be expected, most of the variance in self-regulation was betweenparticipants (81%) (␶00 ⫽ 0.35); only 19% was within-participants
(␴2 ⫽ 0.08). Similarly, an unconditional model predicting forecasted demands showed that more of the variance was betweenparticipants (62%) than within-participants (38%) (␴2 ⫽ 0.12,
␶00 ⫽ 0.08).
To estimate effects of self-regulatory demands at both the
between-participants and the within-participants levels of analysis
we ran a compositional model including the aggregated score for
mean demands across weeks as a participant-level predictor, as
well as weekly scores of demands (group-centered) as the weeklevel predictor (Enders & Tofighi, 2007; Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002). This is the full model:

G00 is the intercept. G01 and G02 represent the main effects of
willpower theories and mean demands on participants’ mean selfregulation failure reports. G03 represents the interaction between
willpower theory and demands, which tests our hypothesis at the
between-participants level. G10 represents the main withinparticipant effect of week-to-week changes in predicted selfregulatory demands on week-to-week self-regulation reports. Finally, G11 represents the cross-level interaction between willpower
theory and self-regulatory demands, which tests effects at the
within-participant level.
Table 3 contains the coefficients for this model predicting the
composite self-regulation failure index as well as each measure of
self-regulation failure. There was a highly significant main effect
of mean demands (G02): High demands were associated with more
self-regulation failure. The main effect of willpower theories (G01)
(irrespective of self-regulatory demands) was significant for procrastination: The more students endorsed a limited-resource theory, the more they procastinated. Most importantly, the interaction
between willpower theories and mean demands (G03) was significant for both the composite index and each measure of selfregulation failure except poor time management. These results
support our hypothesis: a limited theory about willpower predicted

more self-regulation failure among students who experienced
greater self-regulatory demands than their peers.
Figure 1 depicts predicted values of the composite index for
students with a limited-resource (⫹1 SD) and a nonlimited theory
(⫺1 SD) who dealt with high (⫹1 SD) or low (⫺1 SD) mean
self-regulatory demands. Among students who generally faced
high demands, those with a limited-resource theory reported significantly more self-regulatory failures than those with a nonlimited theory, b ⫽ 0.27, se ⫽ 0.07, t(152) ⫽ 3.98, p ⬍ .001.
Among students who faced lower demands, self-regulatory
failures were far less frequent. Interestingly, however, among
these students those with a nonlimited theory showed marginally worse self-regulation than those with a limited-resource
theory, b ⫽ ⫺0.12, se ⫽ 0.07, t(152) ⫽ ⫺1.81, p ⫽ .072. We
return to this interesting effect later.
Next, we tested the key contrast for each index of self-regulation
failure. Among students who faced high demands, those with a
limited-resource theory, relative to those with a nonlimited theory,
procrastinated more (b ⫽ 0.61, se ⫽ 0.14, t(152) ⫽ 4.20, p ⬍
.001), consumed more unhealthy foods (b ⫽ 0.24, se ⫽ 0.12,
t(152) ⫽ 1.99, p ⫽ .048), managed their time marginally more
poorly (b ⫽ 0.16, se ⫽ 0.09, t(152) ⫽ 1.91, p ⫽ .058), and spent
more excessively (b ⫽ 0.16, se ⫽ 0.08, t(152) ⫽ 2.06, p ⫽ .041).
For emotion regulation there was a weak trend in the same direction (b ⫽ 0.14, se ⫽ 0.10, t(152) ⫽ 1.39, p ⫽ .17). To illustrate the
interactions, Figure 2 depicts procrastination and unhealthy eating
behavior for participants with a limited or nonlimited theory who
faced high versus low demands.
For students who faced low demands, willpower theories were
not significantly related to procrastination (b ⫽ ⫺0.15, se ⫽ 0.14,
t(152) ⫽ ⫺1.06, p ⫽ .29), unhealthy eating (b ⫽ ⫺0.16, se ⫽
0.12, t(152) ⫽ ⫺1.35, p ⫽ .18), bad time management (b ⫽ 0.03,
se ⫽ 0.08, t(152) ⫽ 0.38, p ⫽ .70), or excess spending
(b ⫽ ⫺0.11, se ⫽ 0.07, t(152) ⫽ ⫺1.52, p ⫽ .13). Students with
a nonlimited theory, however, reported marginally worse emotion
regulation when demands were low (b ⫽ ⫺0.18, se ⫽ 0.10,
t(152) ⫽ ⫺1.86, p ⫽ .064).

We have suggested that a limited-resource theory undermines
self-regulation when self-regulatory demands are high. A potential
alternative explanation is that students with a limited theory anticipate and have more self-regulatory demands than students with
a nonlimited theory. This was not the case. We ran an HLM
analysis on students’ anticipated self-regulatory demands with
theories about willpower as a participant-level predictor. This
analysis showed no relationship between implicit theories and
anticipated demands, b ⫽ ⫺0.01, se ⫽ 0.02, t(552) ⫽ ⫺0.40, p ⫽
.69. Furthermore, the correlation between theories about willpower
and mean self-regulatory demands was not significant, r ⫽ ⫺.026,
p ⫽ .75. Students with a limited and a nonlimited theory anticipated similar self-regulatory demands. But only students with a
limited theory responded to high demands with more selfregulation failures.

WILLPOWER-THEORIES PREDICT SELF-REGULATION AND GRADES

A second potential alternative explanation, as noted earlier,
involves trait self-control: perhaps students who endorse a limited
willpower theory self-regulate less effectively in the face of selfregulatory challenges simply because they have less trait selfcontrol. This was not the case. We ran an HLM-model predicting
the composite index of self-regulation failure from theories about
willpower, mean demands, and their interaction, as well as trait
self-control and its interaction with mean demands as participantlevel predictors. There was a significant main effect for trait
self-control, b ⫽ ⫺0.39, se ⫽ 0.05, t(146) ⫽ ⫺7.92, p ⬍ .001:
students lower in trait self-control reported more self-regulatory
failures. The interaction between trait self-control and demands
was also significant, b ⫽ ⫺0.07, se ⫽ 0.03 t(146) ⫽ ⫺2.20, p ⫽
.030: When demands were high, students low in trait self-control
reported the most self-regulatory failures. However, importantly,
in this analysis the interaction between theories about willpower
and mean demands remained significant, b ⫽ 0.09, se ⫽ 0.04,
t(146) ⫽ 2.43, p ⫽ .017. The effect of theories of willpower is not
accounted for by differences in trait self-control.
In contrast to these between-participants results, withinparticipant results were not significant (see Table 3). First, withinparticipant (week-to-week) changes in demands (G10) predicted
only procrastination and time management failure. They were not
related to the composite index of self-regulation failure. Second,
there was no cross-level interaction between willpower theories
and within-participant changes in demands (G11). That is, there
was no conjoint effect of participants’ week-to week changes in
demands, corrected for their mean level of demands, and theories
about willpower on weekly reports of self-regulation. We suspect
that a longitudinal study with more intervals over a longer period
of time might be able to better detect conjoint effects of willpower
theories and within-person changes in demands on participants’
self-regulation. Another reason for the lack of within-person effects could be that the cumulative estimate of mean demands
provides a more reliable measure of the demands a student faces
than week-by-week predictions. For example, on the Monday of
one week a student might predict low demands for the upcoming
week, but then might accomplish less over the next few days and
end up having high demands the rest of the week. Or a student
might predict that the week will be a high-demand week but then
an instructor grants the class an extension on an assignment and
the week becomes lower in demands. If so, the anticipation of
demands on a week-by week basis may be less accurate than
cumulative estimates of demands over several weeks.

for prior GPA, the more students endorsed a limited-resource
theory, the lower was their end-of-term GPA.
Next, we tested whether this was especially the case among
students taking a heavy course load. We added course load and the
willpower theories by course load interaction (willpower theories
and course load were independent, r ⫽ ⫺.06, ns). In the final
model (⌬R2 ⫽ .04, F(1, 143) ⫽ 10.74, p ⫽ .001), the main effect
of willpower theories was marginally significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.11,
b ⫽ ⫺.05, se ⫽ .03, t(143) ⫽ ⫺1.80, p ⫽ .08. There was no main
effect of course load, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.04, b ⫽ ⫺.02, se ⫽ .03, t ⬍ 1.
However, the willpower theories by course load interaction was
significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.19, b ⫽ ⫺.09, se ⫽ .03, t(143) ⫽ ⫺3.28, p ⫽
.001. As shown in Figure 3, willpower theories did not predict
GPA among students taking a light course load (1 SD below the
mean, or 10.96 units out of a possible 20), ␤ ⫽ .12, b ⫽ .04, se ⫽
.12, t(144) ⫽ 1.01, p ⫽ .31. But among students taking a heavy
course load (1 SD above the mean, or 18.14 units), those with a
limited-resource theory earned lower GPAs (Mest ⫽ 3.41) than
those with a nonlimited theory about willpower (Mest ⫽ 3.69),
␤ ⫽ ⫺.41, b ⫽ ⫺.14, se ⫽ .11, t(144) ⫽ ⫺3.77, p ⬍ .001. In
addition, a heavy course load was associated with worse performance only for students with a limited-resource theory, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.32,
b ⫽ ⫺.11, se ⫽ .12, t(144) ⫽ ⫺2.81, p ⫽ .006. Students with a
nonlimited theory actually performed slightly better when they had
a heavy course load, ␤ ⫽ .21, b ⫽ .07, se ⫽ .11, t(144) ⫽ 1.81,
p ⫽ .07.
We also tested whether a limited theory predicted worse grades
on a longitudinal basis—that is, when students’ course load increased from one term to the next. We examined students’ currentterm GPA, with prior-term GPA controlled, and tested the effects
of willpower theories, change in course load (difference between
current term course load and previous term course load,

Academic Performance and Course Load
The self-report measures provide nuanced insight into how
willpower theories predict everyday self-regulation in the face of
self-regulatory demands. Next, we tested whether willpower theories also predict an objective (nonself-reported) and cumulative
index of successful self-regulation over time: students’ end-ofterm GPA calculated from official school records. If this shows the
same pattern, it would extend the self-reported indices of selfregulation and further illustrate the implications of theories about
willpower for students’ lives.
Willpower theories and academic performance. To test
whether willpower theories predicted students’ end-of-term GPA,
we conducted a hierarchical regression analysis. First, we con-

interaction. The interaction was significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.13, b ⫽ ⫺.06,
se ⫽ .03, t(143) ⫽ ⫺2.17, p ⫽ .03. Among students whose
decrease in course load was high (Mchange ⫺ 1 SD ⫽ ⫺0.76 –

highly increased (Mchange ⫹ 1 SD ⫽ ⫺0.76 ⫹ 3.26 ⫽ increase of

those with a nonlimited theory, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.35, b ⫽ ⫺.12, se ⫽ .12,
t(144) ⫽ ⫺2.95, p ⫽ .004. These findings confirm that GPA varies
with students’ implicit theories about willpower and their changing
course load.
As was the case for everyday self-regulation, the effect of
willpower theories on GPA was not accounted for by trait selfcontrol. We conducted a hierarchical regression predicting GPA
from previous-term GPA (block 1), theories about willpower,
course load, and trait self-control (block 2), as well as the interactions between course load and trait self-control and between
course load and willpower theories (block 3). In the final model
(⌬R2 ⫽ .54, F(6, 124) ⫽ 24.04, p ⬍ .01) the main effects for trait
self-control and willpower theories were both nonsignificant, ␤ ⫽

course load by trait self-control interaction was also not significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.07, b ⫽ ⫺.03, se ⫽ .03, t(124) ⫽ ⫺1.08, p ⫽ .28.
However, the course load by willpower theory interaction remained significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.23, b ⫽ ⫺.10, se ⫽ .03,

willpower theories predict GPA above and beyond trait selfcontrol.
Mediation. Finally, we tested whether greater procrastination
explained the relationship between a limited willpower theory and
GPA. Past research shows that procrastination leads to lower
grades (Steel, 2007). Likewise, in the present research mean procrastination (averaged over five weeks) predicted GPA controlling
for previous-term GPA [partial r(145) ⫽ ⫺.32, p ⬍ .001]. Since
the previous analysis showed that theories about willpower affect
students’ procrastination, we tested whether students’ mean procrastination mediated the effect of willpower theories on GPA
controlling for previous-term GPA (Figure 4). We did so using the
INDIRECT macro (Preacher & Hayes, 2008), which uses boot-

strapping to estimate the indirect effect of an independent variable
(i.e., willpower theories) on a dependent variable (i.e., GPA)
through a mediator (i.e., procrastination). Because the macro provides only unstandardized path coefficients all variables were
z-standardized prior to using the macro to generate standardized
coefficients. The mediational model was significant, R2 ⫽ .53,
F(3, 144) ⫽ 52.71, p ⬍ .001. As reported earlier, there was a main
effect for willpower theories predicting procrastination; a limited
theory predicted greater procrastination, ␤ ⫽ .18, se ⫽ .07,
t(144) ⫽ 2.60, p ⫽ .01. The direct effect of procrastination on
GPA was also significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.11, se ⫽ .03, t(144) ⫽ ⫺3.75,
p ⬍ .001. The more students procrastinated the lower was their
end-of-term GPA. The bootstrapped indirect effect was different
from zero, 95% CI (⫺.005, ⫺.047), and the direct effect of
willpower theories on GPA was no longer significant, ␤ ⫽ ⫺.03,
se ⫽ .03, t(144) ⫽ ⫺1.30, p ⫽ .20. The other indicators of
self-regulatory failure did not show this meditational pattern. The
results suggest that the more students endorsed a limited-resource
theory of willpower, the more they procrastinated and the lower
the GPA they earned.

General Discussion
The present research shows that students who think that willpower is limited and easily depleted—the view of willpower
suggested by the strength model of self-control—self-regulate less
well in their everyday lives when they face high self-regulatory
demands. Far from conserving their resources and showing strong
self-regulation when needed, students who endorsed the limited
theory and who faced high demands over the term, procrastinated
more (e.g., watching TV instead of studying), ate more junk food,
and reported more excessive spending as compared to students
with a nonlimited theory about willpower. This was the case even
though students with a limited and a nonlimited theory faced
similar self-regulatory demands. By measuring students’ selfregulatory demands, the present study provides the first direct
evidence that it is precisely in the face of consistently high demands that a nonlimited theory of willpower predicts better everyday self-regulation.
Importantly, we found the same pattern for students’ term
grades, an objective and inherently important variable resulting
from successful self-regulation. Among students who took a heavy
course load, students with the limited theory earned lower grades
than students with the nonlimited theory. They did so, a mediation
analysis suggested, because they were more likely to procrastinate
in completing their work. By contrast, the nonlimited theory led
people to deploy their resources more effectively when they were
needed most. Notably, the effects of willpower theories on everyday self-regulation and on GPA did not arise because students with
a limited theory had lower trait self-control. The patterns remained
significant controlling for trait self-control.
Our findings contradict the hypothesis that a nonlimited theory
about willpower undermines self-regulation and does so especially
when demands are high. Relying on a laboratory experiment, Vohs
and colleagues (2012) suggested that the belief that willpower is
nonlimited might counteract ego depletion only in cases of mild or
moderate demands but not when self-control demands are “severe.” They speculated that this belief could even amplify ego
depletion and worsen self-regulation by undermining people’s

WILLPOWER-THEORIES PREDICT SELF-REGULATION AND GRADES

“normal tendency” to conserve their resources and then deploy
them when they were needed. To the contrary, examining students’
success and failure self-regulating in a highly demanding academic
environment, we found that the nonlimited theory was most predictive of better outcomes among students who faced the greatest
demands on their self-regulation.
In fact, it was only among students who faced low demands—
when self-regulation lapses may be less costly—that students with
a nonlimited theory “wasted” their self-regulatory resources relative to those with a limited theory. Under these conditions, they
reported giving in to impulses and pursuing nonacademic activities
at least as much as, if not more than, students with a limited theory.
Thus, students with a nonlimited theory are not self-control super
heroes who never give in to temptations; nor are they unwilling to
admit self-regulatory failure. This view is further supported by the
rather low correlation between theories about willpower and trait
self-control (⫺.17), suggesting that those with a nonlimited theory
are not simply natural self-regulators or people with outsized
self-control abilities. Rather, those with a nonlimited theory are
people who lean in when demands on self-regulation are high.
This pattern was replicated in the analysis of students’ academic
performance, where a nonlimited versus limited willpower theory
predicted higher GPA among students who took heavy course
loads. It was also interesting to find that participants with a
nonlimited theory tended to earn even higher grades when they
were dealing with a heavy course load than when they were taking
a light course load. These latter findings suggest that people with
a nonlimited theory may even profit from challenging circumstances. Indeed, it is possible that in situations where they are not
sufficiently challenged (e.g., in a boring job), people with a nonlimited theory might be the ones to show lower performance. For
them, boredom or lack of challenge may be depleting! In short,
people with a nonlimited theory about willpower look strong when
high demands require effective self-regulation but do not perform
better when demands are low.
Why did Vohs and colleagues (2012) find a different pattern in
a laboratory study—that the benefits of a nonlimited theory for
self-control performance disappeared as the number of self-control
tasks increased? As a laboratory session wears on, many other
factors beyond participants’ self-control capacity may affect their
willingness to exert further self-control on laboratory tasks. For
instance, participants may simply decide that they have done
enough and/or that the tasks are no longer interesting or consequential. A nonlimited theory about willpower would not be functional if it led people to engage on a high level with every task that
came along regardless of its value or purpose. Future laboratory
research may decompose the capacity to exert self-control from the
value or meaning of a task to the self.
In Vohs and colleagues’ (2012) research as well as in other
recent theorizing on ego depletion (Inzlicht & Schmeichel, 2012;
Inzlicht, Schmeichel, & Macrae, 2014) the effects of willpower
theories are grouped together with those of other “motivational”
factors such as monetary incentives. It is often assumed that both
counteract ego depletion through enhanced motivation. Research
on theories about willpower, however, proposes a different perspective. A nonlimited theory does not just motivate people to
regulate themselves better; instead, it removes a process that
undermines self-regulation. Our previous research suggests that a
limited-resource theory makes people more sensitive to or more

645

vigilant for cues that signal the availability of mental resources,
like perceived exhaustion or ingested glucose (Job et al., 2010,
2013). From this perspective people with a limited-resource theory
perform worse under high demands because as soon as they
experience even low-level signs of strain or exhaustion (as soon as
they perceive any “depletion”) they begin to reduce effort on the
task at hand. Instead of staying focused on a demanding task they
turn toward saving and/or replenishing their presumably limited
resources. Thus, willpower theories are not simply another variable that changes the incentive value of a task. Rather, by affecting
the fundamental assumptions people make about the nature and
workings of willpower, they can change how people approach and
enact self-regulation itself.
The present results suggest that a nonlimited theory of willpower is functional in a student sample facing high demands and
likely in other populations facing self-regulation challenges. But if
so, why do many people believe that willpower is limited? Vohs
and colleagues (2012) argued that if a nonlimited theory were
beneficial, these benefits would have led the theory to spread
across individuals and cultures. But a belief need not be functional
to spread. It just has to be simple and appealing (Bangerter &
Heath, 2004; Dawkins, 2006; Wagner, Kronberger, & Seifert,
2002). A fixed mindset about intelligence (the belief that intelligence is fixed not malleable) is a simple and widespread idea that
can have clear negative effects, for instance, in undermining students’ resilience and academic achievement (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Hong, Chiu,
Dweck, Lin, & Wan, 1999). Furthermore, both a fixed mindset
about intelligence and a limited-resource theory about willpower
can have psychological benefits; for instance, as a justification for
putting forth low effort in the face of challenging tasks or temptations (see, e.g., Job et al., 2010; Robins & Pals, 2002).
Although a limited-resource theory might serve some psychological functions, the present research documents its costs.
The ability to self-regulate successfully is one of the most
robust predictors of major life outcomes, including health,
wealth, and well-being (Moffitt et al., 2011). A critical question
for future research involves better understanding the causal
effects of willpower beliefs in everyday settings and, if causal,
how to change these beliefs to increase self-regulatory success.
Laboratory studies show that implicit theories about willpower
can be manipulated and that their effects when manipulated
parallel their effects when measured (Job et al., 2010, 2013;
Miller et al., 2012). Thus, it seems probable that willpower
beliefs have causal effects in everyday life settings and, in these
settings too, they may be changed. Nevertheless, randomized
field-experiments that manipulate willpower beliefs and examine everyday self-regulatory outcomes are necessary to establish causality. Such field experiments would also test a novel
means to improve people’s self-regulatory outcomes, a pressing
issue (Diamond, 2012; Duckworth, Grant, Loew, Oettingen, &
Gollwitzer, 2011). Previous field experiments show that it is
possible to change people’s implicit theories about intelligence
and personality in field settings, with beneficial consequences,
including for academic performance (Aronson, Fried, & Good,
2002; Blackwell et al., 2007) and social outcomes (Yeager,
Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2013). Such interventions give people
information (e.g., scientific reports) about the nature of human
qualities and help them internalize this information using pow-

646

erful persuasive techniques (e.g., “saying-is-believing” exercises, Aronson, 1999; see also Yeager & Walton, 2011). Could
this approach change people’s beliefs about the nature of willpower in a relatively enduring way?
Importantly, it may be essential to pair such learning opportunities with information about effective strategies that can help
people avoid self-regulatory failures. Although the present research did not examine self-regulation strategies, these strategies may be an important consideration in the development of
interventions to promote a nonlimited theory of willpower.
Ironically, simply learning that willpower is stronger than one
might have supposed could backfire if this encourages people to
put themselves in situations they are ill-equipped to deal with
(e.g., keeping temptations close at hand in the belief that they
will be able to resist them indefinitely). Effective selfregulation strategies may involve formulating plans to cope
with temptations (e.g., implementation intentions) or structuring one’s environment to avoid temptations (e.g., putting junk
food in a high cabinet, blocking Facebook while trying to study)
(Duckworth et al., 2011; Magen & Gross, 2007; Neal, Wood, &
Drolet, 2013; Stadler, Oettingen, & Gollwitzer, 2010; Webb &
Sheeran, 2003). Both for broad populations in demanding environments (e.g., students) and for clinical populations (e.g.,
diabetics), it would be exciting if exercises to teach people a
nonlimited theory plus effective self-regulatory strategies could
increase their success as they face stressful demands and strive
to accomplish their goals.
