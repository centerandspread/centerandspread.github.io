This contribution is part of the special series of Inaugural Articles by members of the National Academy of Sciences elected in 2012.

Past research found that the ingestion of glucose can enhance selfcontrol. It has been widely assumed that basic physiological
processes underlie this effect. We hypothesized that the effect
of glucose also depends on people’s theories about willpower.
Three experiments, both measuring (experiment 1) and manipulating (experiments 2 and 3) theories about willpower, showed
that, following a demanding task, only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted (a limited resource theory)
exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. In contrast, people who view willpower as plentiful (a nonlimited resource theory) showed no beneﬁts from glucose—they exhibited
high levels of self-control performance with or without sugar
boosts. Additionally, creating beliefs about glucose ingestion (experiment 3) did not have the same effect as ingesting glucose for
those with a limited resource theory. We suggest that the belief
that willpower is limited sensitizes people to cues about their
available resources including physiological cues, making them dependent on glucose boosts for high self-control performance.

n intriguing ﬁnding in recent years is that the short-term
ingestion of glucose can improve a variety of basic cognitive
and self-regulatory functions including episodic memory, information processing, attention, and self-control (2–5). For instance, studies show that the ingestion of glucose can prevent the
drop in self-control performance that can otherwise follow the
exertion of self-control (6–8), improving such things as persistence and the inhibition of impulses.
In suggesting a close relationship between glucose and cognitive and self-regulatory outcomes, these ﬁndings raise fundamental questions about how physiological and psychological
processes intersect. Popular theories suggest that glucose directly
fuels brain functions, which would otherwise suffer from a lack of
glucose (9–11). These theories can be taken to suggest that optimal performance on everyday cognitive and self-regulatory tasks
requires frequent glucose boosts.
Given the centrality of cognitive performance and self-regulation for human functioning and welfare in general, it would be
striking if these functions were so fragile as to depend to a signiﬁcant extent on the short-term ingestion of glucose (12, 13).
Research shows that various processes in the body (such as
glucose release from the liver) assure that under normal conditions the brain has ample energy supplies for neuronal functioning (14). Moreover, numerous studies show that self-control
performance can be restored by various psychological manipulations (e.g., positive mood, mindfulness meditation) without
glucose ingestion (15–18). Taken together, these ﬁndings imply
that brain functions are unlikely to depend on the short-term
intake of glucose (14, 19). Why then does glucose ingestion
improve self-control performance?

In contrast to the “brain-fueling” hypothesis, we hypothesized
that a culturally shaped belief common in modern society creates
conditions in which glucose facilitates cognitive performance and
self-regulation. If this is the case, it would mean that many of the
limits in self-control attributed to a lack of glucose are imposed
largely by our society and ourselves. Our reasoning is consistent
with the classic theorizing of William James, who wrote, “We live
subject to inhibition by degrees of fatigue which we have come
only from habit to obey” (1, p. 5).
Is it only from habit—stemming from a common cultural belief—that the ingestion of glucose affects subsequent cognitive
and self-regulatory performance? With a particular focus on selfcontrol, we hypothesized that the pervasive belief that willpower
is limited and easily depleted can cause people to become dependent on glucose boosts for optimal functioning. This belief,
which we call a limited resource theory of willpower, may sensitize people to cues about their available resources and their
capacity to sustain a high level of self-control. Glucose ingestion
and the physiological processes it triggers may serve as one such
cue, signaling to people who believe that willpower is highly
limited that they have the capacity to sustain effort.
How might glucose ingestion signal people with a limited resource theory that they have sufﬁcient resources? One route suggested by previous research involves peripheral sensory receptors
(e.g., in the mouth and digestive system), which activate dopaminergic pathways connected to reward regions in the brain (20, 21).
For instance, recent studies ﬁnd that merely rinsing the mouth
with glucose without ingesting it can improve self-control performance (22–24). Thus, people who have ingested glucose may
perform better because these peripheral cues signal the likely
availability of energy, motivating them to sustain effort on difﬁcult tasks (25–27). In the present research, we hypothesized
that such cues are relevant only for people who think that willpower is a limited resource, because only these people are concerned about the availability of mental resources and expect that
their capacity for self-control will diminish as a consequence of the
exertion of self-control.
Signiﬁcance
The present research provides critical new ﬁndings about the
role of glucose ingestion in self-control and cognitive performance. It argues against the popular view that self-control
depends on a limited physiological resource (blood glucose) that
is depleted by even brief acts of self-control and is restored by
glucose consumption. Instead, the results highlight the critical
role of beliefs about willpower in self-control performance.

Our proposal draws on past research that examined people’s
beliefs about the nature of willpower (28). One belief, as noted
above, is the belief that willpower is limited and easily depleted
(assessed with questions like “After a strenuous mental activity,
your energy is depleted and you must rest to get it refueled
again”). The other belief, which we call the nonlimited resource
theory,* is the idea that willpower is not easily used up but can
even be activated through the exertion of self-control (e.g.,
“After a strenuous mental activity, you feel energized for further
challenging activities”). Job et al. (28) found that only people with
a limited resource theory performed more poorly on cognitive
and self-control tasks as demands on self-control accumulated.
People who believed—or who had been led to believe—that
willpower is nonlimited continued to perform well on a series
of tasks regardless of whether they had previously exerted selfcontrol or not.
Importantly, this past research provides initial evidence that
people with a limited resource theory perform worse after a
demanding task because they are sensitive to cues about the
availability of mental resources. Although people induced to
hold a limited resource theory and a nonlimited theory of willpower found an initial demanding task equally fatiguing, only for
those with the limited resource theory did the extent to which
they found the task fatiguing predict worse performance on the
next self-control task.
If a limited resource theory sensitizes people to cues about the
availability of resources, one such cue could be glucose and the
physiological response it triggers (22). If so, only people with
a limited resource theory about willpower should exhibit glucosedependent self-control performance. By contrast, people with a
nonlimited theory of willpower should perform well regardless
of whether they have consumed glucose or not.
Moreover, if it is really the belief that accounts for differences
in the reaction to glucose ingestion and not a preexisting difference between groups (e.g., in glucose tolerance), then the
same ﬁndings should emerge both when willpower theories are
measured as an individual difference and when they are manipulated experimentally.
Overview of Studies
Three experiments tested the joint effect of lay theories about
willpower and glucose ingestion on self-control performance
following an initial demanding task. Lay theories about willpower were measured in experiment 1 and manipulated in
experiments 2 and 3 to test their causal effect. In experiment 3,
the belief that one had ingested sugar was additionally manipulated to see whether the mere belief would have the same effect
as actually ingested glucose. Across all studies, we predicted that
only people with a limited resource theory of willpower would
show poor performance following a demanding task and improved performance with the ingestion of glucose.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 tested the effects of ingesting a sugar drink as
opposed to an artiﬁcially sweetened drink on self-control after
a demanding task. We predicted, as noted, that this effect would
differ as a function of people’s lay theory about willpower. Participants (n = 87) were recruited for a study on perception of
food and tasks. Following past studies, they were asked not to eat
or drink anything but water in the 2 h before the study (8, 9).
During the session, participants ﬁrst completed several scales
including the implicit theories about willpower scale (six items)

*The term nonlimited should not be confused with unlimited. People with a nonlimited
theory of willpower reject the view that willpower is highly constrained and easily depleted (e.g., by a relatively modest act of mental exertion). However, such people do not
necessarily view willpower as limitless and are not immune to depletion from highly
strenuous tasks of long duration.

(28). Next, they drank and evaluated lemonade sweetened with
either sugar (140 calories) or a sugar substitute (0 calories). We
allowed 10 min to pass before the key dependent measure
(the time prescribed by past research for glucose to exert its
physiological effect) (9). During this time, all participants completed a demanding self-control task that required them to override a previously established habit (crossing out every “e” in a text)
based on a more complex rule that required them to cross out
some “e’s” but not others (29, 30). Finally, as the primary outcome, participants completed a computer-based Stroop task,
a frequently used measure of self-control (31). Color words
appeared on a screen in a font color that was either congruent
(48 trials) or incongruent (48 trials) with the color name. Participants were instructed to identify as quickly as possible the
font color. When the word-color combination is incongruent
(e.g., the word “green” written in red), participants must inhibit
the interfering word meaning to respond with the correct font
color. As a measure of self-control performance on the Stroop
task, we examined the difference in reaction time between congruent and incongruent trials (Stroop interference).
Conﬁrming the success of random assignment, there were no
differences between the sugar and nonsugar conditions in participants’ theories of willpower or any other variable assessed
before the tasting task. However, although participants could not
detect whether they had consumed a sugar or a nonsugar beverage (χ2 < 1), they liked the sugar drink (mean = 4.66, SD =
1.45) more than the sugar-substitute drink (mean = 3.67, SD =
1.53) [t(85) = 3.15, P = 0.002]. We therefore included the liking
of the beverage as a covariate in our analyses. Including this
covariate did not alter the results.
A hierarchical regression analysis of Stroop interference was
conducted with control variables in the ﬁrst block,† experimental
condition (sugar = 0, nonsugar =1) and lay theories about willpower (centered) in the second block, followed by their interaction term in the third block.
Neither the main effect of drink condition nor the main effect
of lay theories about willpower was signiﬁcant; their interaction,
however, was signiﬁcant [b = 30.62, seb = 14.56, ΔR2 = 0.05, t(78) =
2.10, P = 0.04]. Fig. 1 displays Stroop interference as a function
of drink condition and willpower theory (for participants 1 SD
above and below the mean). Participants with a limited resource
theory who consumed the nonsugar drink show greater Stroop
interference than the other three groups. A simple slopes analysis yielded a signiﬁcant effect of drink condition for participants
with a limited resource theory [b = 43.34, seb = 20.52, t(78) =
2.11, P = 0.04]. Their self-control performance was better in the
sugar condition than in the nonsugar condition. However, participants with a nonlimited theory showed no difference between
the sugar and nonsugar conditions [t(78) < 1]. If anything, they
performed more poorly in the sugar condition. Further, theories
about willpower predicted Stroop performance within the nonsugar condition [b = 21.72, seb = 10.77, t(78) = 2.02, P = 0.05].
Without sugar, participants with a limited theory performed
more poorly than those with a nonlimited theory. Within the
sugar condition, theories about willpower were not related to
performance [t(78) ≤1].‡
These results demonstrate that the effect of glucose on selfcontrol after a demanding task depends on people’s theories
†

First, age was controlled for, because it is known to predict Stroop performance (32). In
the third block, it had a marginal effect [β = −0.15, t(79) = −1.39, P = 0.17]. Second, we
included a dummy variable for the two laboratory rooms where participants were
seated. The rooms differed in the intrusion of outside noise, which may explain a slight
difference in Stroop performance between them [β = −0.20, t(79) = −1.86, P = 0.07].
Finally, accuracy (the total number of errors on the Stroop task) was included [β = 0.22,
t(78) = 2.10, P = 0.04] to control for speed-accuracy tradeoffs.

‡

The same analyses with accuracy as the dependent variable did not yield signiﬁcant
results either in experiment 1 or in experiment 3.

about willpower. Only people with a limited theory of willpower
performed better after consuming glucose.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 manipulated theories about willpower to test their
causal effect. It also sought to extend our ﬁndings to a different
measure of cognitive performance. Theories of willpower were
manipulated by having participants (n = 62) complete a biased
eight-item questionnaire that was altered from the original
questionnaire by adding words like “can” or “sometimes” to
foster agreement with either a limited theory (e.g., “Working on
a strenuous mental task can make you feel tired such that you
need a break before accomplishing a new task.”) or a nonlimited
theory (e.g., “Sometimes, working on a strenuous mental task
can make you feel energized for further challenging activities.”)
(28). Next, participants completed the same tasting task as in
experiment 1, followed by a 10-min task requiring self-control.
For the latter task, participants wrote about a recent trip without
using the letters “a” or “n” (33, 34). As the dependent measure,
participants were then given eight moderately difﬁcult nonverbal
IQ problems. Each problem contained a series of geometric
ﬁgures. Participants were asked to identify from a set of possible
solutions the ﬁgure that completed the series. This type of intellectual performance requires active self-regulation and is
particularly susceptible to decrements after self-control exertion
(35). Participants had 20 s to ﬁnd the correct solution to each IQ
problem. The number of problems answered incorrectly served
as the measure of (poor) self-control performance. By using a
different task to tax self-control and a different dependent measure of self-control, experiment 2 ensures that the effects observed are not speciﬁc to the tasks used in experiment 1.
As in experiment 1, participants were unable to detect what kind
of beverage they had consumed [χ2(1) = 1.10, P = 0.29]. In addition, in this study, there was no effect of sugar vs. nonsugar on
participants’ reported liking of the beverage [t(60) = 1.11, P = 0.27].
To test whether the theories of willpower manipulation moderated the effects of sugar, we conducted an ANOVA on the
total number of failed IQ problems. The predicted interaction
was signiﬁcant [F(1,58) = 5.16, P = 0.03, η2 = 0.08; Fig. 2].
Paralleling the results of experiment 1, simple-effects analyses
revealed that participants in the limited theory condition performed more poorly in the nonsugar condition than in the sugar
condition [F(1,58) = 6.32, P = 0.01, η2 = 0.10]. However, participants in the nonlimited theory condition showed no effect of
drink condition [F(1,58) = 0.52, P = 0.47, η2 = 0.01]. Further,
within the sugar-substitute condition, participants in the nonlimited theory condition performed better than participants in
Job et al.

Experiment 3
The major aim of experiment 3 was to replicate the ﬁndings of
experiments 1 and 2 and to examine the impact of beliefs about
the glucose content of the beverage. We suggested that a limited
theory sensitizes people to cues that can tell them about the
availability or nonavailability of resources that might be relevant
to the exertion of self-control, such as feelings of fatigue (28) and
the ingestion of glucose (experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3
tested whether the belief that one has consumed sugar would
have the same effect as actually consuming sugar and improve
self-control performance among people with a limited theory
about willpower.§ Would a limited willpower theory sensitize
people to both top-down cues (the belief that one has consumed
sugar) and bottom-up cues (bodily cues that might result from
the ingestion of sugar) or would it sensitize people to bodily cues
alone (22)? At the same time, the study tests whether a nonlimited theory of willpower liberates people from a dependence
on both kinds of cues.
Additionally, we removed the restriction that participants not
eat or drink for 2 h before the study to make the ﬁndings more
widely applicable. Removing the restriction also provided a more
stringent test of our hypothesis that those with a limited willpower theory are sensitive to local cues, because participants
were not deprived of glucose at the start of the study and any
deﬁcit in willpower would come solely from their experience with
the depleting task.
Participants (n = 154) completed one of the two versions
of the biased questionnaire to manipulate their theories about
willpower. Then they performed the tasting task (consuming a
sugar or sugar-substitute drink). Fully crossed with the drink
manipulation used in experiments 1 and 2 was a third manipulation. Participants were told that the drink contained either
sugar or a sugar substitute. During the subsequent 10 min, all
participants performed a thought suppression task requiring selfcontrol. They were asked to write down all their thoughts on a
piece of paper without thinking about a white bear (36).{ As in
experiment 1, participants then completed a Stroop task as the
dependent measure of self-control performance. Finally, they
completed a manipulation check for the sugar-expectation manipulation. When asked whether they believed the drink was
ﬂavored with sugar or a sugar substitute, all participants agreed
with their assigned sugar-expectation description.
There was no effect of induced theories or beliefs about sugar
(or their interaction) on liking of the beverage, and the two
beverages did not differ in how much they were liked.
We entered the Stroop interference scores into a 2 (drink
condition: nonsugar vs. sugar) × 2 (theory condition: nonlimited vs. limited) × 2 (sugar-expectation condition: nonsugar vs.
sugar) ANOVA.jj Replicating experiments 1 and 2, there was

glucose ingestion.

The thought suppression task was followed by several questions about participants’
overall mood. There were no effects of the experimental manipulations on these questions and they were unrelated to subsequent self-control performance.

To follow the same analytic approach as study 1, analyses controlled for age and accuracy on the Stroop task. In study 3, these were not signiﬁcant covariates [F(1,139) < 1]
and removing them does not change the results. We did not control for different laboratory rooms, because all participants worked in cubicles in the same room.

a signiﬁcant interaction between theory condition and drink condition [F(1,139) = 5.28, P = 0.02, η2 = 0.04; Fig. 3]. Participants in
the limited theory condition showed better Stroop performance
when they had consumed glucose compared with sugar substitute [F(1,139) = 6.53, P = 0.01, η2 = 0.04]. For participants in
the nonlimited theory condition, the glucose content of the
drink did not affect Stroop performance [F(1,139) < 1]. Within
the sugar-substitute condition, participants in the nonlimited
theory condition outperformed participants in the limited theory condition [F(1,139) = 4.45, P = 0.04, η2 = 0.03]. In the sugar
condition, there was no effect of induced theory [F(1,139) =
1.15, P = 0.29, η2 = 0.01].
The main effect of the sugar expectation condition and its
interactions with both drink condition and theory condition were
all non signiﬁcant [Fs(1,141) < 1]. Those with a limited willpower
theory were not swayed by explicit information about whether
they had ingested glucose. They were swayed only by internal
cues that resulted from the consumption of a drink with or
without sugar.**
Replicating experiment 2, experiment 3 shows that people led
to think of willpower as reliant on a limited resource became
dependent on glucose: they exerted self-control more successfully after having consumed glucose than not and they performed
worse without glucose than participants led to think of willpower
as nonlimited. Furthermore, the data indicate that for people
with a limited resource theory, just believing that they had consumed sugar did not improve performance. They seem to be
sensitive speciﬁcally to internal signals about the availability
of resources.
General Discussion
This research shows that a seemingly basic physiological process,
the effect of glucose ingestion on self-control, depends on cultural beliefs about the nature of willpower. Replicating past research, we found that glucose ingestion can improve self-control
and cognitive performance following the exertion of self-control
(8). However, this effect occurred only when people endorsed

**Although there was no effect of beliefs about sugar consumption on Stroop interference (reaction time to incongruent − congruent trials), an interesting pattern emerged on
reaction times overall. Analysis across all trials with HLM yielded a signiﬁcant three-way
interaction between theory condition (nonlimited = 0, limited = 1), drink condition (nonsugar = 0, sugar = 1), and sugar expectation condition (nonsugar = 0, sugar = 1) [b = 43.88,
seb = 15.17, t(11800) = 2.89, P = 0.004]. Being told that the drink contained sugar made
participants with a limited theory who had in fact consumed a diet beverage respond
faster overall [b = −38.64, seb = 8.31, t(2811) = −4.65, P = 0.001]. However, it did not affect
their capacity for self-control, as shown by the null effect of the sugar expectation condition on Stroop interference.

the theory that willpower relies on a limited resource or had
been led to endorse this belief experimentally. When people
believed instead that willpower is not limited (experiment 1) or
when they had been led to endorse this belief (experiments 2 and
3), they did not need glucose to sustain high levels of self-control
performance. A nonlimited theory of willpower liberates people
from the need for constant glucose boosts to exert self-control
successfully. Put the other way around, the performance enhancing effect of glucose arises in part because people behave in
the context of a cultural belief that willpower is limited and
readily depleted.
These results provide compelling evidence against the theory
that self-control really does rely on a limited physiological resource that is depleted by even brief acts of self-control and is
restored by glucose consumption (8, 11). Again, only those who
believe that willpower relies on a limited resource show poor
performance without sugar and a replenishment effect with
sugar. We suggest that those who believe that willpower is not
highly limited show no replenishment effect when given sugar
because they do not need one and/or because they are not vigilant for cues about the availability of mental energy. Future research may further analyze and test these mechanisms. However,
by demonstrating that glucose boosts are not necessary for
people with a nonlimited resource theory, our results suggest
that failures in self-control, at least in the normal course of
events, do not result from a ﬁxed physiological constraint involving a shortage in the supply of glucose.
This conclusion should not be taken to imply that glucose is
irrelevant to human functioning. We do not doubt that glucose is
the major fuel of cerebral processes (14, 37). Indeed, because the
brain cannot afford to run out of glucose, the body contains
redundant mechanisms to ensure its supply (14, 19, 38).
The implication that people do not need frequent sugar boosts
to self-regulate effectively is especially important in a society that
faces an epidemic of obesity and glucose-related disorders (e.g.,
type II diabetes) (39, 40). The present ﬁndings suggest that cultivating a culture in which people understand that willpower is
not highly limited but rather self-generating—teaching that selfcontrol begets self-control—may liberate people from the need
for frequent sugar boosts or a dependence on other momentary
internal or external cues that signal the availability of resources in
their everyday lives (e.g., hunger, hours of sleep, time of the day,
social conventions to take a break). Previous research has shown
that it is possible to change people’s beliefs about the malleability
of other aspects of the self, such as intelligence and personality,
and that doing so can improve intellectual and interpersonal

Methods
Experiment 1. Participants and design. Eighty-seven students at a US university
(50 females, Mage = 20.83) participated in a “study on food and task perception” in exchange for course credit or $10. Participants were asked not to
eat or drink anything but water for 2 h before the study. There were two
independent variables: participants’ implicit theory of willpower (measured)
and glucose vs. nonglucose ingestion (manipulated).
Procedure. Participants took part individually. The procedure followed past
studies on glucose ingestion and self-control (8, 10). Instructions and tasks
were presented on a computer to ensure standardization across participants.
First, participants provided informed consent and demographic information,
reported their current hunger and thirst, reported when and what they last
ate and drank, and completed several scales. Embedded among these was
the theories about willpower scale (six items) (28). Items included “After
a strenuous mental activity your energy is depleted and you must rest to get
it refueled again” (limited theory) and “Your mental stamina fuels itself;
even after strenuous mental exertion you can continue doing more of it”
(nonlimited theory) (1 = strongly agree, 6 = strongly disagree). Items referring to the limited theory were reverse-scored so that higher values
represent greater agreement with the limited resource theory (α= 0.81,
mean = 4.17, SD = 0.74).
Next, following past research (8), participants drank 14 oz of Kool-Aid
lemonade described only as “a beverage.” The drink was sweetened with either sugar (140 calories) or a sugar substitute (Splenda; 0 calories). To bolster
the cover story, participants then evaluated the drink’s taste and appearance.
Again following past research, we allowed 10 min to pass before the key
dependent measure (the time prescribed by past research to allow glucose to
exert its physiological effects) (10). During this time, all participants completed a task used in previous research, which requires people to exert selfcontrol (18, 29, 30). This paper-and-pencil task, described as a “stimulus
detection task,” consisted of two parts each lasting 5 min. First, all participants crossed out every “e” on a page of typewritten text; this is designed
to establish a behavioral pattern. Next, they performed a version of the task
with complex rules that required them to inhibit the previously established
response in certain instances (e.g., not to cross out “e’s” followed by vowels).
Finally, participants completed a computer-based Stroop task, which
provided the critical self-control outcome. Color words appeared on the
screen (red, green, yellow, blue) in a font color that was either congruent or
incongruent with the meaning of the word. On each of 96 trials (48 incongruent), participants were instructed to press a key marked with the color
the word was written in. On incongruent trials, the meaning of the word
interferes with naming its color and has to be suppressed. Only correct Stoop
trials (95%) were included in the analysis. Data were corrected on the trial
level (i.e., identifying outlying trials within each individual) and on the group
level (i.e., identifying outliers on Stroop interference). Outlying trials were
deﬁned as ≥3 SDs from each individual’s mean within each trial category
(congruent and incongruent) and were removed from analyses. Removing
outlying trials led to the exclusion of 1.08% of all correct trials (48). Stroop
interference was calculated by subtracting the mean reaction time for
congruent trials from the mean reaction time for incongruent trials. Two
participants were identiﬁed as statistical outliers on the Stroop interference
score, >3 SDs above the mean, and removed from analyses.

pool (40 females; Mage = 25.62) took part in exchange for 10 Swiss francs. As
in experiment 1, participants were asked not to eat or drink anything but
water in the 2 h before the study.
Materials and procedure. First, we manipulated lay theories about willpower.
Following a procedure validated in past research (28), participants completed
a biased eight-item questionnaire (translated into German) formulated to
foster agreement with either a limited theory (e.g., “Working on a strenuous mental task can make you feel tired such that you need a break before
accomplishing a new task”) or a nonlimited theory (e.g., “Sometimes,
working on a strenuous mental task can make you feel energized for further
challenging activities”) (1 = strongly agree, 6 = strongly disagree). Onesample t tests comparing the mean in each condition to the scale midpoint
(3.50) indicated that participants agreed with the suggested theory in both
the limited theory condition [mean = 2.19; t(31) = −12.63, P < 0.001] and the
nonlimited theory condition [mean = 2.32; t(30) = −9.00, P < 0.001].
Next, participants completed the same tasting task as in experiment 1,
followed by a 10-min writing task, used in previous research that require selfcontrol (33, 34). Participants wrote about a recent trip without using the
letters “a” or “n.”
As the dependent measure, participants were then given eight moderately
difﬁcult IQ problems. They were asked to select which of ﬁve ﬁgures best
completed a series of ﬁgures, with 20 s allotted to each problem. The number
of IQ problems not answered correctly served as the measure of poor selfcontrol performance (35).
As in experiment 1, participants then reported whether they thought the
beverage they had drunk contained sugar or a sugar substitute, completed
the suspicion check, and were debriefed.
Experiment 3. Participants. One hundred ﬁfty-four German students (128
female, Mage = 22.78) took part in a study on “perception of tastes and tasks”
in exchange for 5 Euros.
Procedure. As in experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to
complete one of the two versions of the biased questionnaire to manipulate
lay theories about willpower. They then performed the tasting task. Fully
crossed with the drink manipulation used in experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., sugar
vs. sugar substitute) was a third manipulation. Participants were told the
drink contained either sugar or a sugar substitute. As in the previous studies,
they then drank the full beverage before evaluating it. During the subsequent 10 min, all participants performed a task requiring self-control. They
were asked to write down all their thoughts on a piece of paper without
thinking about a white bear (36). Every time they thought of a white bear
they were asked to make a mark in the margin of the paper.
Finally, participants completed a Stroop task, which was slightly altered
from that used in experiment 1. The proportion of incongruent trials was
reduced to one-third to make a correct response on these trials more difﬁcult
(49, 50). To keep the number of incongruent and congruent trials equal, we
therefore included control trials in which only a colored square appeared. In
total, participants completed 130 trials, 10 practice trials followed by 40
trials of each kind (congruent, incongruent, and control) in a random order.
Only reaction times for correct trials were included in the analysis. Reaction
times were trimmed as in experiment 1, which led to the exclusion of 1.37%
of all correct trials. Stroop interference was calculated by subtracting the
mean reaction time for congruent trials from the mean reaction time for
incongruent trials. Five participants were identiﬁed as statistical outliers
and removed from analyses (two were >3 SDs above the mean in the
Stroop interference; three answered fewer than half of the incongruent
trials correctly).
At the end of the study, participants were asked what they thought the study
was about; no participant guessed the study’s purpose. In addition, a manipulation check conﬁrmed that all participants believed the manipulation of the
description of the drink (i.e., as containing sugar vs. a sugar substitute).

INAUGURAL ARTICLE

At the end of the study, participants were asked whether they thought the
beverage they had drunk contained sugar or a sugar substitute and what they
thought the study was about; no participant guessed the study’s purpose.
Finally, participants were debriefed and reimbursed.

outcomes in a relatively enduring way (41–43). Future research
should test whether interventions that foster a nonlimited theory
of willpower can help people sustain high levels of self-control in
important real-world settings.
Is just believing that willpower is not highly limited sufﬁcient
for successful self-control? Certainly not, but it may be an important ingredient. People also need effective self-regulation
strategies to put this understanding to work. Such strategies
might involve arranging situations to minimize temptations (e.g.,
keeping junk food out of the house; blocking Facebook while
trying to study) or planning in advance when, where, and how to
act or respond to difﬁculties (e.g., “If I feel like having a chocolate snack I’ll go and get a fruit cup.”) (44–47). With a nonlimited mindset and effective strategies, people may exert selfcontrol over an extended period without frequent glucose boosts.
As William James (1) suggested more than a century ago, people
have far greater capacity to exert self-control than they may
believe—or than a simple glucose model would suggest.
