Much Ado About Grit: A Meta-Analytic Synthesis of the Grit Literature

Grit has been presented as a higher order personality trait that is highly predictive of both success and
performance and distinct from other traits such as conscientiousness. This paper provides a meta-analytic
review of the grit literature with a particular focus on the structure of grit and the relation between grit
and performance, retention, conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and demographic variables. Our results
based on 584 effect sizes from 88 independent samples representing 66,807 individuals indicate that the
higher order structure of grit is not confirmed, that grit is only moderately correlated with performance
and retention, and that grit is very strongly correlated with conscientiousness. We also find that the
perseverance of effort facet has significantly stronger criterion validities than the consistency of interest
facet and that perseverance of effort explains variance in academic performance even after controlling for
conscientiousness. In aggregate our results suggest that interventions designed to enhance grit may only
have weak effects on performance and success, that the construct validity of grit is in question, and that
the primary utility of the grit construct may lie in the perseverance facet.

over many years” (Duckworth as quoted in Perkins-Gough, 2013,
p. 16). Duckworth et al. argue that grit can help to explain why
some individuals perform better than their scores on ability tests
might predict and that grit was a core contributor to the success of
highly accomplished individuals such as Albert Einstein. Recently,
Duckworth (2013a) has even argued that grit is as good or even a
better predictor of success than cognitive ability; a strong claim
given meta-analytic findings that cognitive ability correlates about
␳ ⫽ .50 with performance in academic and work settings (Sackett
et al., 2012; Schmidt & Hunter, 1998).
Despite the widespread enthusiasm for grit as a potentially novel
predictor and determinant of performance there are sound empirical and theoretical reasons why a critical reappraisal of the nature
of the grit construct, its contribution to our understanding of
performance, and its general position within the nomological network may be warranted. It is the goal of this paper to present
findings from a meta-analytic synthesis of the rapidly growing
empirical literature on grit to help shed light on the nature and
construct validity of grit, and to highlight potentially new areas of
inquiry for grit researchers. We begin by reviewing the literature
relating to five core theoretical features of grit: (a) the proposed
hierarchical structure of grit, (b) the relation of grit with performance, (c) the distinction of grit from conscientiousness, (d) the
distinction of grit from cognitive ability, and (e) the lack of group
differences on grit.

Interest in noncognitive variables as potential predictors and
determinants of academic performance has been spurred by metaanalytic findings that variables such as study habits and study
skills (Credé & Kuncel, 2008; Robbins et al., 2004), personality
traits such as conscientiousness (Poropat, 2009, 2014), test anxiety
(Hembree, 1988; Seipp, 1991), adjustment (Credé & Niehorster,
2012), emotional intelligence (Perera & DiGiacomo, 2013), and
learning strategies (Credé & Phillips, 2011; Richardson, Abraham
& Bond, 2012), exhibit relations with academic performance that
are often comparable to relations between admissions test scores
and academic performance (e.g., Hezlett et al., 2001). Many of
these noncognitive characteristics also appear to be responsive to
interventions. For example, meta-analytic reviews have demonstrated that interventions can reduce anxiety (Hembree, 1988), and
improve study skills (Hattie, Biggs, & Purdie, 1996) as well as
social and personal skills (Durlak, Weissberg, & Pachan, 2010).
One additional noncognitive variable that has received widespread attention and that has been widely touted as an important
predictor of success and performance is a personality trait referred
to as grit (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, & Kelly, 2007; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). Grit is defined as “perseverance and
passion for long-term goals” (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, &
Kelly, 2007, p. 1087) and as “. . . not just resilience in the face of
failure, but also having deep commitments that you remain loyal to

Grit as a Hierarchical Construct
Grit is typically operationalized as a higher-order construct with
two lower order facets: “perseverance of effort” and “consistency
of interest.” These two facets (hereafter referred to as perseverance
and consistency), respectively refer to the tendency to work hard
even in the face of setbacks and the tendency to not frequently
change goals and interests. Both are thought to contribute to
success: persistence because the process of attaining mastery in a

field often involves initial failures that the individual must persist
through, and consistency because many hours of deliberate practice are normally required to achieve mastery (Ericsson, Krampe,
& Tesch-Römer, 1993). That is, individuals who either disengage
their efforts in the face of obstacles or who constantly change their
interests are unlikely to ever engage in enough deliberate practice
to achieve high levels of performance. The distinction between the
two facets is reflected in the subscales of the two primary selfreport inventories used to measure grit: the Grit Scale (Duckworth
et al., 2007) and the Short Grit Scale (Duckworth & Quinn,
2009)— both of which can be found on Angela Duckworth’s
homepage (https://sites.sas.upenn.edu/duckworth/pages/research).
Although some researchers examine perseverance and consistency
as two separate constructs, most research on grit only reports
findings at the level of the overall grit score.
This practice appears to be informed by two factors. First,
Duckworth et al. (2007) in their discussion of the two facets state
that “. . . neither factor was consistently more predictive of outcomes than the other, and in most cases, the two together were
more predictive than either alone” (p. 1091). Second, Duckworth
and Quinn (2009) reported examining the theoretical higher-order
factor structure of grit using confirmatory factor analysis, and
claimed support for the higher-order structure based on their
finding that the higher order model (comprised of two first-order
factors and one second-order factor) exhibits significantly better fit
than a single-factor model. However, the reported analysis is
problematic because a model with one second-order factor and two
first-order factors is not identified at the higher-order level (Kline,
2011); this means that no unique loadings onto the higher-order
factor can be computed without additional constraints being imposed. However, it does not appear that Duckworth and Quinn
imposed the type of equality constraints on the loadings of the
first-order factors onto the higher-order factor that would be required to achieve identification because they report nonidentical
loadings of the first-order factors onto the higher-order factor.
Importantly, even if an equality constraint had been imposed at the
higher-order level the resultant higher-order model would have
exhibited identical fit to a model with two correlated first-order
factors and no higher-order factor (see Credé & Harms, 2015 for
a discussion). That is, a model in which the persistence and
consistency facets are simply two correlated constructs would
exhibit identical fit to the higher-order model. Interestingly, Duckworth and colleagues had tested the fit of such a two-factor model
in an earlier paper (Duckworth et al., 2007), and reported relatively
poor fit for the model (i.e., comparative fit index ⫽ .83, root mean
square error of approximation ⫽ .11). The confirmatory factor
analysis strategy for determining whether a higher-order grit construct exists is therefore not particularly meaningful because standard indexes of model fit cannot be used to distinguish between a
higher-order model and a model with two correlated factors.
A potentially more useful approach would involve examining
the correlation between the two theoretical facets of grit; high
correlations would suggest that a higher order construct is plausible. However, empirical estimates of the strength of this relation
exhibit substantial variability, with some reporting correlations
that are close to zero (e.g., Chang, 2014; Datu, Valdez, & King,
2015; Jordan, Gabriel, Teasley, Walker, & Schraeder, 2015), while
others have reported very strong correlations (e.g., Arslan, Akin, &
Çîtemel, 2013; Meriac, Slifka, & LaBat, 2015). A meta-analytic

synthesis will help to establish a population estimate of the correlation between the two facets and thereby allow readers to make a
more informed judgment about whether or not grit exhibits the
hypothesized higher-order structure. This will in turn help to
determine whether the practice of simply summing across the
perseverance and persistence items to compute an overall grit
score (as recommended by Duckworth et al., 2007) is reasonable,
or whether the two facets should be considered separately.

Grit as a Predictor of Success and Performance
Proponents of grit as a predictor of performance have argued
that between-person differences in grit can help to explain why
two individuals with the same level of ability in a particular
domain are often observed to perform at substantially different
levels. Specifically, individuals with high levels of grit are thought
to be able to better utilize their capabilities because they are less
distracted by short-term goals and less discouraged by the failures
and setbacks that are commonly encountered in many performance
domains. Indeed, Duckworth et al. (2007) described that the importance of grit for success had long been noted by prior research
into highly accomplished individuals (e.g., Howe, 1999). Arguments for the importance of grit are also in line with work on the
development of expertise that has highlighted the importance of
sustained deliberative practice (e.g., Ericsson, Krampe, & TeschRömer, 1993; Krampe & Ericcson, 1996). Indeed, recent work by
Duckworth, Kirby, Tsukayama, Berstein and Ericsson (2011) has
explicitly tied grit to success in spelling bees via the mediating
mechanism of deliberative practice. That is, individuals who are
high on grit are more likely to engage in the amount of deliberative
practice that is required to achieve expertise.
At the same time, there are a number of theoretically plausible
moderators of the grit-performance relation that suggest that the
relation may not be strong in all— or even most—settings. First,
the grit-performance relation may be moderated by the nature of
the performance domain. Specifically, high levels of grit may be
most useful when the task is difficult but well defined; that is, high
levels of sustained effort and deliberative practice are required to
succeed and the manner in which performance is to be attained is
relatively clear (see MacNamara, Hambrick & Oswald, 2014).
Thus, grit may be an excellent predictor of an individual’s ability
to complete military basic training or succeed in well-defined
academic tasks, but be less well related to performance on tasks
that are very easy (thus not requiring grit) or performance on tasks
that are novel and ill-defined and that therefore require both
creativity and the willingness to abandon unsuccessful strategies
(i.e., tasks on which grit may be counterproductive). Second, the
grit-performance relation may be moderated by other individual
differences such as ability and metacognition (Credé & Phillips,
2011). That is, high levels of grit may not necessarily be adaptive
unless it is accompanied by the general potential or ability to
succeed in a domain and the ability to engage in the type of
reflection and self-monitoring that the self-regulated learning literature (e.g., Zimmerman, 1990) and the social– cognitive view of
learning (e.g., Ryan & Pintrich, 1997; Zimmerman, 1994, see also
Kohn, 2014) has identified as important determinants of learning
and performance. For example, cadets who lack some minimum
level of physical ability to pass the highly strenuous tests of
physical ability in a military academy are unlikely to benefit

substantially from grit. Similarly, a cadet who is unable to recognize that a particular approach to studying for class material is not
working is unlikely to perform well in academic courses.
Third, the grit-performance relation may be moderated by the
level of grit itself. Very high levels of grit may become dysfunctional if they reduce the likelihood of help-seeking behaviors that
have themselves been linked to performance (e.g., Karabenick,
2003) or if they increase the likelihood that an individual persists
too long in attempting to solve a problem that is particularly
difficult rather than spending their time on other, more solvable
problems (see Lucas, Gratch, Cheng, & Marsella, 2015). This
would, in turn, suggest that interventions designed to enhance grit
levels may not benefit all individual equally. A recent large-scale
evaluation of the impact of resiliency interventions (Paunesku et
al., 2015) found that such interventions benefit primarily those
students who were most at risk of dropping out of high schools and
provided less benefit for other students. Meta-analytic evidence
suggests similar effects for resilience interventions in working
populations (Vanhove, Herian, Perez, Harms, & Lester, 2015). A
similar nonlinear relation may also exist for grit.
A more nuanced conceptualization of grit’s contribution to performance also seems warranted when reconsidering the biographical
details of some of the highly accomplished scientific figures referenced by Duckworth et al. (2007) to highlight the importance of grit.
For example, it is true that Albert Einstein persisted for many years in
his attempt to develop the field equations that represent the mathematical description of general theory of relativity, but it is also true
that Einstein persisted for years in pursuing an avenue of investigation
that was based on an earlier mathematical error. Einstein also appears
to have only resolved some of the challenging mathematical obstacles
after consulting with the mathematicians Marcel Grossman and (later)
David Hilbert (Earman & Glymour, 1978) who, according to some
accounts (e.g., Parker, 2004), almost scooped Einstein in the development of the mathematical framework for the general theory of
relativity because of Einstein’s delay in seeking assistance. That is,
persistence in this narrow case almost resulted in “failure” and Einstein only “succeeded” in this particular endeavor once he recognized
his mathematical limitations and sought the help of more accomplished mathematicians.
The possibility that the grit-performance relation is not uniformly
strong is also strongly suggested by an examination of the empirical
literature. Some have found that grit scores are relatively strongly
related to success as suggested by the initial findings by Duckworth
and colleagues (e.g., Strayhorn, 2013), but many others (e.g., Chang,
2014; Cross, 2013; Davidson, 2014; Hogan, 2013; Sheehan, 2014)
have failed to find strong relations between grit scores and indicators
of success. This is particularly the case for studies examining academic success. Indeed, many of the reported relations between grit
and academic success are weaker or equal to the relation of ␳ ⫽ .21
and ␳ ⫽ .23 that has been reported between conscientiousness and
academic performance in two recent large-scale meta-analytic reviews (e.g., Porapat, 2009; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012).
Meta-analytic synthesis will not only help to clarify the strength of the
relation between grit and success but will also help to clarify whether
the observed variability in relations is simply a function of sampling
error and other study artifacts (e.g., differences in the reliability in the
measurement of variables), or if this variability reflects the presence
of meaningful moderators.

A meta-analytic summary should also help to address possible
confusion among readers of the grit literature about the ability of grit
to predict the successful completion of rigorous programs. This confusion may have arisen because the authors of both of the foundational papers (Duckworth et al., 2007; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009)
appear to confuse odds ratios with probabilities in their discussion of
logistic regression results, resulting in incorrect inferences about the
size of observed effects. This misunderstanding may have led readers
to infer a much greater predictive power for grit scores than is
warranted. For example, Duckworth and Quinn (2009) discussed the
ability of grit scores to predict the successful completion a summer
program for cadets from the United States Military Academy at West
Point and interpret an odds ratio of 1.99 to mean that “Cadets who
scored a standard deviation higher than average on the Grit-S were
99% more likely to complete summer training” (p. 171). This interpretation is incorrect because approximately 94% of all cadets successfully completed the program. A relatively small increase in the
completion rate from, say, 95% to 97.5% associated with a one point
increase in grit scores would, of course, represent an odds ratio of 2,
but this is only a 2.6% increase in the likelihood of completing the
program.
A meta-analytic synthesis will also help to establish whether
either of the two facets of grit exhibit higher levels of criterion
validity than the other or whether the two are largely equivalent in
their relation with important outcomes as suggested by Duckworth
and colleagues (2007, p. 1091). This might, in turn, change the
manner in which grit scores are presented and interpreted. Many
grit researchers follow the recommendations by Duckworth et al.
and examine only an overall grit score. However, facets are often
better predictors than broad traits (e.g., Paunonen & Ashton,
2001), and substantial differences between the grit facets to predict
important criteria might suggest that this scoring strategy should
be revisited.
A meta-analytic synthesis of the strength of the relation between
grit and success will also help to inform judgments about whether
interventions designed to enhance grit are likely to have an impact
on performance. Initial reports of the high predictive validity of
grit scores and their relative independence from indicators of
cognitive ability, combined with claims that grit can be taught
(Perkins-Gough, 2013), has resulted in some schools implementing interventions designed to increase students’ levels of grit. For
example, The Knowledge is Power Program network of public
charter schools is training its teachers to foster grit in their pupils
(Shechtman, DeBarger, Dornsife, Rosier, & Yarnall, 2013), while
many school districts across the US are reportedly considering
integrating the teaching of grit into curricula (Cohen, 2015). Grit
was even highlighted as a promising focus of school interventions
in a U.S. Department of Education report (Shechtman et al., 2013).
The time and resources that are likely to be devoted to grit-based
interventions in schools are likely to be nontrivial and should
therefore only be based on the best available knowledge about the
role of grit in predicting and determining performance.

The Distinction of Grit From Conscientiousness
An interest in what Duckworth and colleagues refer to as grit,
perseverance, and consistency is not new to psychology. Studies of
attributes such as will power, tenacity, determination, persistence
of motives, and volitional perseveration date back over 80 years

CREDÉ, TYNAN, AND HARMS

(see Ryans, 1939 for an early review). More recently, researchers
have investigated a variety of other trait-like constructs that are
characterized by persistence and consistency including proactivity
(e.g., Crant, 1995), persistence (e.g., De Fruyt, Van de Wiele, &
Van Heeringen, 2000), industriousness (e.g., Eisenberger, 1992;
Jackson, Paunonen, & Tremblay, 2000), need for achievement
(McClelland, 1985), conscientiousness, and some of the facets of
conscientiousness such as industriousness, self-control, and order
(Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark & Goldberg, 2005). The conceptual
similarities between these constructs and grit raises the possibility
that the proponents of grit may have fallen victim to what Kelley
(1927) referred to as the “jangle fallacy”—the belief that two
things are different simply because they have different names. The
contribution of grit to the psychological literature would, of
course, be severely limited if the construct was simply a case of
“old wine in new bottles” and it would therefore appear to be
important to formally establish the discriminant validity of grit
relative to these related constructs. There has however been almost
no empirical investigation of the discriminant validity of grit from
these other constructs using the types of methodologies (e.g.,
Mulitrait-multimethod matrices, confirmatory factor analyses)
commonly employed to determine discriminant validity, despite
the fact that grit has been explicitly presented as a construct that is
distinct from these previously examined constructs—particularly
conscientiousness and need for achievement (Duckworth et al.,
2007; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009; Perkins-Gough, 2013). The
bivariate relation of grit with conscientiousness has often been
reported by researchers but even for conscientiousness (and its
facets) there are both empirical and theoretical reasons for suspecting that the overlap with grit may be stronger than is widely
assumed.
For example, the definition of grit as “perseverance and passion
for long-term goals” (Duckworth et al., 2007) is highly similar to
the definitions given by Costa and McCrae (1992) for the selfdiscipline facet (“capacity to begin tasks and follow through to
completion despite boredom or distractions”) and the achievement
striving facet of conscientiousness (“need for personal achievement and sense of direction”). This theoretical similarity is also
reflected in the considerable similarity in the items that are found
in the Duckworth et al. (2007) perseverance subscale and items in
widely used inventories of conscientiousness such as those provided by the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, Goldberg,
1999). For example, perseverance items such as “I finish whatever
I begin” and “I am a hard worker” are very similar to IPIP items
used to measure achievement striving such as “I carry out my
plans” and “I work hard.” Items from the consistency scale overlap
less strongly with items from conscientiousness inventories and
are instead more similar to IPIP items used to measure the adventurousness facet of openness to experience and the IPIP measure of
planfulness that is modeled after the Achievement via Conformance scale found in the California Personality Inventory (Gough,
1996).
A cursory examination of the empirical grit literature also suggests that the grit— conscientiousness relation may be much stronger than is commonly assumed. While some (e.g., Cooper, 2014)
have presented evidence the grit is largely distinct from conscientiousness, numerous others have reported correlations between grit
and conscientiousness that approach unity when correcting the
observed correlations for unreliability. Reed, Pritschet and Cutton

(2012), for example, report a correlation of ␳ ⫽ .92 based on 1165
college students, Engel (2013) reports a correlation of ␳ ⫽ .95
based on a smaller sample of 88, and Meriac, Slifka, and LaBat
(2015) report a disattenuated correlation of ␳ ⫽ .98 based on a
sample of 322 students. Even Duckworth et al. (2007) and Duckworth and Quinn (2009) report correlations between conscientiousness and grit scores that rise to ␳ ⫽ .97 (N ⫽ 1,554); ␳ ⫽ .90
(N ⫽ 706), ␳ ⫽ .83 (N ⫽ 190), and ␳ ⫽ .80 (N ⫽ 1,308) after
correcting for the unreliability of both conscientiousness scores
and grit scores. High correlations such as these have led some
(e.g., MacCann & Roberts, 2010) to suggest that grit should be
considered a facet of conscientiousness—a position that seems
theoretically plausible when considering that both grit and the
self-control or self-discipline facet of conscientiousness focus on
the deferment of short-term gain for long-term goals (see Costa &
McCrae, 1992; Roberts, Bogg, Walton, Chernyshenko, & Stark,
2004). High observed correlations between grit and conscientiousness are also of concern when considering that a concurrent
assessment of the same personality trait using different scales
typically yields much lower correlations of around r ⫽ .50 (e.g.,
Pace & Brannick, 2010; Miller, Price & Campbell, 2012). Metaanalytic synthesis of the literature on the grit-conscientiousness
relation will help clarify whether the strength of the relation is such
that grit might be a case of the “old wine in new bottles” phenomenon.

The Distinction of Grit From Cognitive Ability
Grit is typically described as being largely distinct from cognitive ability (Duckworth et al., 2007; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009;
Perkins-Gough, 2013), although Duckworth (2013a, 2013b) has
also suggested a negative relation between grit and cognitive
ability in noting that “. . . gritty people, on average, tend to be
slightly less talented” Duckworth (2013b, p. 18). This distinction,
if correct, suggests that grit might explain unique variance in
performance over and above the substantial variance in performance accounted for by cognitive ability (e.g., Kuncel, Hezlett,
Ones, 2004). Further, a finding that grit is largely orthogonal from
general cognitive ability would also suggest that interventions
designed to enhance grit levels might result in substantial increases
in performance. Primary research findings have found broad support for the assertion that cognitive ability and grit are largely
distinct. Many of the studies in this domain utilize admissions test
scores as a proxy for cognitive ability test scores but this approach
seems reasonable when considering that cognitive ability tests
administered in research settings have questionable validity because many test takers will not be motivated to exert maximal
effort on ability tests in a low-stake setting (Duckworth, Quinn,
Lynam, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2011). Most commonly
used college admissions test scores are highly correlated with
cognitive ability test scores (e.g., Frey & Dotterman, 2004) and are
also taken under maximal performance (i.e., high stakes) conditions and are therefore likely to represent a sound indicator of
cognitive ability. Research examining the relation between grit
scores and admissions test scores have largely found very weak
relations (e.g., Chang, 2014; Duckworth et al., 2007; EskreisWinkler, Duckworth, Shulman, & Beal, 2014; Kelly, Matthews, &
Bartone, 2014).

Group Differences in Grit Scores
Concerns about the reliance on cognitive ability tests for the
prediction of success and performance have often revolved around
the persistent finding that groups exhibit nontrivial mean score
differences on such tests (e.g., Camara & Schmidt, 1999; Davis et
al., 2013). A finding that grit exhibits smaller differences between
groups is likely to make the construct more attractive in settings
where scores are used for selection purposes or for making other
high-stakes decisions because the likelihood of adverse impact on
legally protected groups is reduced. Prior research suggests only
one type of group difference. Duckworth et al. suggested that grit
might increase with age—a phenomenon that has also been observed for conscientiousness (Roberts, Walton, & Viechtbauer,
2006)— but prior findings from the personality literature (e.g.,
Costa, Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001; Foldes, Duehr, & Ones,
2008) suggest that differences across ethnicities and gender are
likely to be more modest than those observed for ability measures.
Empirical findings on the direction and strength of the relation
between grit scores and demographic variables such as age (e.g.,
Engel, 2013, Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014), gender (e.g., Allen,
2014; Davidson, 2014), and ethnicity (e.g., Chang, 2014; EskreisWinkler, Shulman, & Duckworth, 2014) have been mixed and a
meta-analytic synthesis will help to clarify whether average grit
scores are largely similar across groups.

The General Position of Grit Within the
Nomological Network
Grit has been not only been related to performance, cognitive
ability, and conscientiousness but also to a wide array of other
variables reflecting either states or traits. These include Big Five
traits (e.g., Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014), optimism (e.g., Lovering
et al., 2015), psychological well-being (e.g., MacCann & Roberts,
2010); suicide ideation (Blalock, Young, & Kleiman, 2015), intended persistence in academic programs (e.g., Bowman et al.,
2015), and life satisfaction (e.g., Samson et al., 2011). A metaanalytic synthesis of the relation of grit with these other variables
will further help to clarify the general position of grit within the
broader nomological network.

with academic performance in college: (a) indicators of cognitive
ability such as scores on the SAT and (b) prior academic performance such as high school grade point average (GPA; Sackett et
al., 2012). Other predictors that correlate approximately at ␳ ⫽ .40
with academic performance include study skills and study habits
(Credé & Kuncel, 2008), academic adjustment (Credé & Niehorster, 2012), academic self-efficacy (Robbins et al., 2004), and class
attendance (Credé et al., 2010). These appear to be the best known
predictors of academic performance in college. Other variables
that meta-analyses have shown to exhibit weaker but practically
still very meaningful relations of around ␳ ⫽ .20 with academic
performance include (a) specific learning strategies (Credé &
Phillips, 2011), (b) emotional intelligence (Perera & DiGiacomo,
2013), (c) conscientiousness (Porapat, 2009), and (d) test anxiety
(Hembree, 1988).
The ability to predict retention is typically weaker. Metaanalytic findings indicate that the best predictors are: academic
self-efficacy (␳ ⫽ .36) and academic-related skills (␳ ⫽ .37,
Robbins et al., 2004), institutional attachment (␳ ⫽ .29) and social

Method
Search Strategy
Potential sources for inclusion in our review were identified
using keyword, abstract, and title searches of the PsycINFO,
Dissertations Abstracts, and ERIC databases using the search term
“grit.” This yielded a total of 778 potential data sources. These
search results were supplemented by an examination of the reference lists of identified sources. We also examined the first 500
search results of the Internet using the Google search engine and
the search term “grit” to identify additional unpublished sources of
information. Potential sources for inclusion were first screened by
examining the abstract and title of the source and all possible
sources were then examined more closely to determine if the
reported data met the inclusion or exclusion criteria.

Interpreting Criterion-Related Validity Estimates
Cohen’s (1988) guidelines for what constitutes small (r ⫽ .10),
medium (r ⫽ .30), and large (r ⫽ .50) effect sizes are widely used
to describe the size of the relation between a predictor variable and
a criterion variable. However, the American Psychological Association (Wilkinson, 1999) has also encouraged researchers to place
effect sizes in a practical and theoretical context. To this end we
briefly discuss meta-analytic estimates of the criterion-related validity of various widely studied predictors of academic performance and retention. We use these meta-analytic estimates to
inform our assessment of the relative ability of grit to predict
academic performance and retention, although it is also important
to note that even a relatively low criterion validity can be practically very important— especially when the predictor provides information about the criterion that is not provided by other predictors and when the criterion is important.
Prior meta-analyses of predictors of academic performance have
identified two variables that correlate at approximately ␳ ⫽ .50

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Sources were included in our review if they reported on the
Pearson correlation between scores on any of the Duckworth et al.
(2007, 2009) measures of grit and other variables— or if they
reported information that could be used to estimate the size of such
a correlation (e.g., means and standard deviations for two criteria
groups). The year of publication, source of the material, and
country of origin of the data were not used to exclude any sources,
although non-English sources were excluded. Sources were also
excluded if they reported correlations for individuals below a
middle school age because personality is still highly fluid at earlier
ages, and because prior meta-analyses on personality as a predictor
of achievement (Poropat, 2014) found that the strength of the
relation at younger ages was very different to the relation at older
ages. We also excluded one study that only reported on significant
correlations (and excluded nonsignificant correlations) because the
inclusion of this data would have resulted in an upwardly biased

effect size estimate. When studies did not report data in a format
that could be coded and when these studies had been published in
the last five years we attempted to contact the authors to request
the necessary information. Data from a total of 73 studies representing data from 88 unique samples and 66,807 individuals was
ultimately included in the analyses.

Coding Procedure
All articles were coded by two of the authors using a systematic
coding procedure, one of whom has extensive experience coding
articles for meta-analytic analyses. An accuracy check revealed
98.8% agreement in coding across the four most important coding
categories. 60% of coding errors were errors of commission (e.g.,
incorrect coding of an effect size) and 40% were errors of omission
(e.g., an effect size that could have been computed was not coded).
All disagreements were resolved via discussion. Each correlation
that was included in our review was described using 10 coding
categories: (a) the size of the correlation, (b) the sample size, (c)
the reliability of the grit scores, (d) the reliability of the correlate
scores, (e) the name of the correlate, (f) the source of grit ratings
(self-ratings or other-ratings), (g) the source of the correlate data
(self-ratings, other-ratings, records), (h) whether the grit scores
reflected overall grit or either of the two facets: consistency and
perseverance, (i) the source of the publication (peer-reviewed vs.
not peer-reviewed), and (j) the year of publication. Self-reported
grades are very highly correlated with actual grades (Kuncel,
Credé, & Thomas, 2005), and we therefore included correlations
with grades irrespective of whether the grade information was
based on self-reports or were obtained from records. When sources
reported correlations involving both self-reported grades and
grades obtained from records we coded the correlations involving
grades obtained from records. A summary of the coding of the
most important variables is included in the Appendix.

Transformations
Our coding process involved three transformations of data. First,
we used formulas presented by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) to
calculate estimates of the correlation between grit and correlate
variables when the original sources had artificially dichotomized
the correlate variable (e.g., presenting grit scores for “low” and
“high” scoring students). The artificial dichotomization of data
results in downwardly biased estimates of the population correlation if such a correction is not made. Second, we used the formula
presented by Ghiselli, Campbell, and Zedeck (1981) to calculate
composite correlations when the original source only presented
correlations involving the facets of grit and/or facets of the correlate variable. For example, Bowman et al. (2015), presents correlations among the two facets of grit, fall GPA, and spring GPA; the
six correlations among these four variables were used to arrive at
an estimate of the correlation between overall grit and overall
GPA. Mosier reliability estimates for composite variables (Mosier,
1943) were also calculated whenever possible. Finally, we computed point-biserial correlations between retention and grit when
the mean and standard deviation of grit scores were reported for
both the retained and nonretained group.

Criterion Categories
Grit researchers have examined the relation of grit with a wide
variety of indicators of success. Meta-analytic synthesis requires a
grouping of similar criteria with each other but because success
criteria can be grouped in a wide variety of ways we present
meta-analytic estimates for 10 criterion categories. First, we present separate meta-analytic estimates of the relation between grit
and high school GPA, college GPA, and postgraduate GPA. Second, we aggregate these into a broader general GPA criterion
category (i.e., GPA across all three educational levels). For this
general GPA criterion category we relied on the correlations for
the more recent college GPA when authors reported correlations
involving both high school GPA and college GPA. We then also
combined this general GPA category further with correlations
involving grades in individual courses to form an academic performance criterion category. Third, we present meta-analytic estimates of the point-biserial correlation between grit and retention.
Most studies examining retention do so in an academic or military
setting (e.g., degree completion, completion of basic training) but
one study also examined marital status as an indicator of retention
(i.e., staying married vs. getting a divorce or separating), and we
therefore present meta-analytic estimates both with and without
the study on marital retention. We also present findings for a
criterion representing a collection of nonacademic criteria comprised of performance in spelling bees, military settings, and
athletics. Finally, we also present meta-analytic estimates of the
relation between grit and the intent to persist in both college and
with a particular employer.

State, Trait, and Demographic Categories
Grit researchers have examined the relation between grit and a
variety of other variables that represent both relatively stable
personality traits such as the Big Five personality traits and cognitive ability, and variables that have a strong mood and emotion
component and that could therefore be described as falling somewhere along the state-trait continuum (e.g., happiness, depression,
positive affect). We use the descriptors of these variables as given
in our source articles to group these various state and trait variables
into categories and computed meta-analytic estimates for those
categories for which at least three effect sizes were reported. We
also report meta-analytic estimates of the relation between grit and
four demographic variables (gender, age, year in school and ethnicity).

Statistical Method
We used the Hunter and Schmidt (2004) interactive metaanalytic method based on a random-effects model to arrive at
population estimates of the size of the relations between grit and
other variables. The Schmidt and Le (2004) software was used to
compute meta-analytic estimates of the relations involving grit and
we corrected for unreliability in the measurement of the dependent
variable and unreliability in the measurement of the independent
variable. Grit scores are likely to be exhibit some level of range
restriction in many samples but the absence of normative data on
grit scores and variance in how grit is measured (e.g., number of
items, number of response options) did not allow us to correct for
range restriction.

GRIT META-ANALYSIS

Corrections for unreliability. To correct for the attenuating
effect of measurement error on the size of the observed correlations we constructed reliability artifact distributions from the reliability information that was described in the included studies.
These reliability distributions are described in Table 1. The included studies did not report information on the reliability of
grades but to facilitate an apples-to-apples comparison with the
recent meta-analytic summary of the relation between conscientiousness and academic performance by Poropat (2009) we corrected for the unreliability of grades using a distribution of reliability estimates for that was largely similar to the reliability
estimates used by Poropat (2009). For GPA information taken
from records we used the average of reliability estimates (␣ ⫽ .90)
for all courses across four years as reported by Bacon and Bean
(2006) while for self-reported GPA we used the operational validity estimates of .90 for college GPA and .82 for high school
GPA as reported in the meta-analysis by Kuncel et al. (2005).
Other analytic decisions. For the meta-analysis involving the
retention criteria we took a dual analytical approach. More than
half of the studies examining the relation between grit and retention did not report means and standard deviations for those individuals who dropped out of a program and for those individual
who stayed in the program. Instead these authors reported odds
ratios, but odds ratios cannot be directly transformed into a pointbiserial correlation when the independent variable is treated as a
continuous variable. We therefore present two meta-analytic estimates for the grit-retention relation. We provide one estimate

based purely on those studies that report data that could be transformed into a point-biserial correlation, and then provide another
estimate that includes correlation values computed by taking the
root of the Nagelkerke R2 values reported for those studies that
reported odds ratios from bivariate logistic regression models.
Nagelkerke R2 values tend to be too high as an estimate of the
strength of the bivariate relation (Allison, 2014) but we include
these values to provide readers with an estimate based on the most
complete data. We remind readers that this estimate is likely to be
upwardly biased.
We present meta-analytic estimates of the relations of overall
grit (or the two grit facets) with other variables whenever at least
three studies reported on such a relation. We summarize our
meta-analytic findings for each relation using six pieces of information: (a) k refers to the number of studies used to compute the
estimates, (b) N refers to the total sample size used to compute the
estimate, (c) robs refers to the sample-size weighted average observed correlation, (d) ␳ refers to the estimate of the population
correlation, (e) SD␳ refers to the estimate of the standard deviation
of effect sizes after taking into account the variability that is due to
sampling error and differences in the reliability of measurement
between studies, and (f) 10% and 90% coefficients of variation
represent the upper and lower bounds of the 80% credibility
interval. The width of the credibility interval is indicative of the
presence of undetected moderators. That is, wide credibility intervals indicate that the correlation can be expected to vary widely
across settings.
To examine whether grit scores explain incremental variance in
academic performance outcomes over and above the variance
explained by conscientiousness we constructed a full meta-analytic
intercorrelations matrix between grit, conscientiousness, and academic performance by importing the conscientiousness correlations of ␳ ⫽ .21 for high school GPA and ␳ ⫽ .23 for college GPA
as reported by Poropat (2009), and using the average of these (␳ ⫽
.22) for overall academic performance. These correlation matrices
were then used to perform hierarchical regression analyses based
on the harmonic mean of sample sizes.

Results
Before proceeding with our primary analyses we first examined
the data from the studies included in this meta-analytic review for
publication and source bias.

Publication and Source Bias
We examine the possibility that the literature included in this
meta-analytic review represents a biased sample of the research on
grit in two ways. First, to examine whether the published and
unpublished literature report grit-performance relations of different magnitudes we report separate meta-analytic estimates based
on those studies that were published in peer-reviewed journals and
all other studies (e.g., dissertations, conference presentations).
Because of the limited number of total studies that report correlations at the facet level we only perform this analysis for overall
grit. Results are presented in Table 2. In general the evidence for
source bias is weak with only small differences in correlations
reported for overall academic performance, the overall GPA criterion, and undergraduate GPA. None of the differences in correlations were significant at ␣ ⫽ .05.

Second, we use Egger’s test of funnel-plot asymmetry (Eggers,
Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997) to examine whether there is
evidence in the meta-analysis for the exclusion of small studies
with weak effects. Studies with small sample sizes that find weak
effects may not be published and not found via literature searches
and their exclusion may result in an overestimate of the strength of
an effect. Egger’s test regresses the standard normal deviate of the
effect size for each sample onto the precision of the effect size
estimate. The intercept of the regression line provides information
about the size of any asymmetry; statistically significant negative
intercepts suggesting that small studies with weak effects may
have been suppressed from the literature. Because of the relatively
small number of studies that examined any one relation we only
perform a single test of asymmetry for the relation based on the
largest number of studies: the relation between grit and overall
academic performance. For this relation Egger’s test indicated no
significant asymmetry with the intercept being negative but weak
and not significantly different from zero (a ⫽ ⫺.15, p ⫽ .85).
The absence of evidence for strong source bias and publication
bias suggests that our meta-analytic estimates are unlikely to be
substantially biased in either a positive or negative direction by
missing studies. We therefore present meta-analytic estimates of
the relation of grit with criteria, state and trait variables, and
demographic variables in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

Relation Between Perseverance and Consistency
Our meta-analytic estimate of the relation between perseverance and consistency (k ⫽ 17, N ⫽ 22,048, ␳ ⫽ .60, SD␳ ⫽ .21),
indicates a generally strong relation although the width of the
credibility interval suggests that the strength of this relation is
substantially moderated. As an exploratory follow-up analysis
we compared the relation observed for the two different grit
scales and found a stronger relation when researchers relied on
the short grit scale (k ⫽ 11, N ⫽ 18,996, ␳ ⫽ .66, SD␳ ⫽ .15)
than when the original grit scale was used (k ⫽ 6, N ⫽ 3,052,
␳ ⫽ .27, SD␳ ⫽ .17).

Relations With Criteria
Overall grit exhibits a relation with overall academic performance of ␳ ⫽ .18 (k ⫽ 39, N ⫽ 13,141, SD␳ ⫽ .11) and ␳ ⫽ .17
with the overall GPA criterion (k ⫽ 37, N ⫽ 12,601, SD␳ ⫽ .10).
Among the academic performance criteria grit was approximately
as strongly related to college GPA (k ⫽ 30, N ⫽ 10,526, ␳ ⫽ .17,
SD␳ ⫽ .10) as it was to high school GPA (k ⫽ 17, N ⫽ 6,364, ␳ ⫽

.16, SD␳ ⫽ .14). Contrary to early assertions by Duckworth et al.
(2007) that both facets predicted success outcomes equally well,
the perseverance facet of grit exhibited much stronger relations
with all academic performance criteria than the consistency facet.
For example, perseverance correlated at ␳ ⫽ .26 (k ⫽ 11, N ⫽
5,221, SD␳ ⫽ .12) with overall academic performance while consistency correlated at only ␳ ⫽ .10 (k ⫽ 11, N ⫽ 5,221, SD␳ ⫽
.02). A comparison of the correlations of perseverance and consistency with four academic performance criteria using the procedure for comparing correlated correlation coefficients described by
Meng, Rosenthal, and Rubin (1992) showed that the correlations
differed significantly (p ⬍ .001) in all four cases.
Grit correlated with retention at ␳ ⫽ .12 when the marital
success study is included (k ⫽ 11, N ⫽ 17,525, SD␳ ⫽ .09), at ␳ ⫽
.18 (k ⫽ 10, N ⫽ 11,163 SD␳ ⫽ .03) when it was excluded, and at,
␳ ⫽ .16 (k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 2,705, SD␳ ⫽ .06) if the upwardly biased
correlations estimated from Nagelkerke R2 values are excluded.
Grit was correlated at ␳ ⫽ .21 (k ⫽ 7, N ⫽ 4,116, SD␳ ⫽ .00) with
performance in nonacademic domains. The relation between grit
and the intent to persist in college and with the current employer
was ␳ ⫽ .18 (k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 3,967, SD␳ ⫽ .00), and ␳ ⫽ .15 (k ⫽ 4,
N ⫽ 519, SD␳ ⫽ .00), respectively.

Relation With State and Trait Variables
Consistent with the claim that grit and cognitive ability are
largely orthogonal, grit exhibited only a very weak relation with
cognitive ability (k ⫽ 21, N ⫽ 11,513, ␳ ⫽ .05, SD␳ ⫽ .12).
Similarly weak relations with cognitive ability were also observed
for both the perseverance facet (k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 2,204, ␳ ⫽ ⫺.01,
SD␳ ⫽ .04) and consistency facet (k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 2,204, ␳ ⫽ .00,
SD␳ ⫽ .00).
Grit exhibited much stronger relations with other trait variables.
Conscientiousness was very strongly correlated with overall grit
(k ⫽ 22, N ⫽ 18,826, ␳ ⫽ .84, SD␳ ⫽ .07) and also with
perseverance (k ⫽ 8, N ⫽ 4,967, ␳ ⫽ .83, SD␳ ⫽ .14) and
consistency (k ⫽ 8, N ⫽ 4,967, ␳ ⫽ .61, SD␳ ⫽ .17). Grit also
exhibited a very strong relation with self-control (k ⫽ 4, N ⫽
2,615, ␳ ⫽ .72, SD␳ ⫽ .05), a variable that is often seen to be a
facet of conscientiousness (e.g., Roberts et al., 2005). Grit also
exhibited a relatively strong relation with emotional stability (k ⫽
14, N ⫽ 14,501, ␳ ⫽ .41, SD␳ ⫽ .04), but this should not be
surprising when considering that low levels of emotional stability
are likely to be associated with an inconsistency of interest because
negative affect states may be interpreted as a signal that the
activity being engaged in is no longer interesting. Grit also

exhibited relatively strong relations with a number of other
variables that are sometimes presented as having a causal
influence on success and performance, including, generalized
self-efficacy (k ⫽ 3, N ⫽ 1,908, ␳ ⫽ .43, SD␳ ⫽ .11), mental
toughness (k ⫽ 6, N ⫽ 3,817, ␳ ⫽ .46, SD␳ ⫽ .08), positive

(k ⫽ 5, N ⫽ 3,865, ␳ ⫽ ⫺.48, SD␳ ⫽ .12).

Relation With Demographic Variables
As expected, the relations between grit and demographic variables such as gender (k ⫽ 25, N ⫽ 18,750, ␳ ⫽ .05, SD␳ ⫽ .07),
year in school (k ⫽ 4, N ⫽ 2,961, ␳ ⫽ .05, SD␳ ⫽ .05), and ethnic
minority status (k ⫽ 9, N ⫽ 15,261, ␳ ⫽ .01, SD␳ ⫽ .01) were all
very weak with the exception of age, which exhibited a slight
positive correlation with overall grit (k ⫽ 22, N ⫽ 12,349, ␳ ⫽ .12,
SD␳ ⫽ .04) in line with the prediction by Duckworth et al. (2007)
that grit would increase with age. This increase is similar to the
general increase in conscientiousness observed with age (Roberts
et al., 2006).

Incremental Validity
The incremental validity estimates from these regression results
are summarized in Table 6. Results for Model 1 indicate that
overall grit explains no variance in either overall academic performance or high school GPA after controlling for conscientiousness, and explains only a very small amount of incremental
variance in college GPA (i.e., ⌬R ⫽ .004). Importantly, conscientiousness explains incremental variance in these outcomes if first
controlling for overall grit. Results for Model 2 show that perseverance explained a substantial amount of incremental variance in
overall academic performance (⌬R ⫽ .040), high school GPA
(⌬R ⫽ .085), and a somewhat lower amount for college GPA
(⌬R ⫽ .023). Consistency explained almost no unique variance in
the three criteria after controlling for either conscientiousness (see
Model 3) or both conscientiousness and persistence (Model 4) and
the negative sign of the regression coefficients for consistency for
the overall academic performance and college GPA criteria also
suggests a possible suppressor effect. Perseverance explained relatively large amounts of unique variance in three criteria even after
controlling for both conscientiousness and consistency (Model 5).
Overall, the incremental validity findings suggest that both overall
grit and the consistency facet of grit add little to our ability to
understand or predict academic performance, while the perseverance facet does offer an important improvement in explanatory
power.

Discussion
Proponents of grit have asserted that grit is a higher order
construct composed of a perseverance facet and a consistency
facet, that grit scores are highly predictive of success (and a better
predictor of success than cognitive ability), and that grit scores
provide information about individuals that is meaningfully distinct
from conscientiousness. Three primary findings from our metaanalytic review of the grit literature suggest that the validity of
these assertions may need to be revisited; although our findings
also suggest that a revised approach to the study of grit may still

hold value for our understanding of the determinants of performance.
First, our findings indicate that the current evidence does not
support the claim that grit is a higher-order construct that is
characterized by two lower-order facets. The original factor analytic studies could not speak to the presence of a higher-order
factor structure because of methodological limitations, and our
results indicate that the practice of combining perseverance scores
and consistency scores into an overall grit score appears to result
in a significant loss in the ability to predict performance. That is,
perseverance is a much better predictor of performance than either
consistency or overall grit and should therefore probably be treated
as a construct that is largely distinct from consistency to maximize
its utility.
Second, overall grit exhibits relations with academic performance and retention that are only modest and that do not compare
favorably with other well-known predictors of academic performance such as cognitive ability (Sackett et al., 2012), study habits
and skills (Credé & Kuncel, 2008), and academic adjustment
(Credé & Niehorster, 2012). Indeed, meta-analytic reviews of the
literatures for some of these other predictors report correlations
with academic performance and retention that are more than twice
as big as those observed for overall grit in this review. At the
same time it should be remembered that variables that exhibit
small to moderate effect sizes can still be very useful in highstakes settings because even marginal improvements in individuals’ performance— or organizations ability to predict this performance— can have very meaningful positive effects. For
example, a grit intervention that increasing the retention rate in
college by even a single percentage point would potentially
benefit thousands of college students. Similarly, even a small
increase in the ability to predict future performance in a selection setting may yield very substantial financial benefits for an
organization (see Hunter & Hunter, 1984 for a discussion).
Such a benefit would be particularly large if the variable in
question reflected information about individuals that was dis-

tinct from the information reflected by other well-known predictors of performance and retention.
Our third primary finding suggests that the incremental value of
grit for the prediction of performance is likely to be limited. Grit
scores exhibited very strong correlations with conscientiousness
and with self-control—a facet of conscientiousness. Indeed, the
size of the correlation (␳ ⫽ .84) with overall conscientiousness is
so strong as to not only limit the incremental value of grit scores
for the prediction of performance over and above conscientiousness but also suggest that grit may be redundant with conscientiousness. Indeed, the correlation between overall grit and conscientiousness, and between persistence and conscientiousness (␳ ⫽
.89) is much stronger than what is typically found between scores
on two different global measures of conscientiousness (␳ ⫽ .63;
Pace & Brannick, 2010). This, in turn, suggests that grit research
may have fallen victim to the jangle fallacy and that grit as
currently measured is simply a repackaging of conscientiousness
or one of the facets of conscientiousness. McCornack (1956), of
course, illustrated that two variables can be very strongly correlated but still exhibit very different correlations with a third variable but the meta-analytic estimates of the relation between overall
grit and GPA in middle/high school (␳ ⫽ .16) and college (␳ ⫽
.17) are largely identical (if somewhat weaker) to those reported
for conscientiousness in the recent meta-analytic review by Porapat (2009): ␳ ⫽ .21 for middle/high school GPA and ␳ ⫽ .23 for
college GPA.
Although our findings indicate that a critical reappraisal of
the grit construct is warranted, three meta-analytic findings
reported in this paper do hold some promise for proponents of
grit as a predictor of success and as a potential focus of
interventions. First, grit predicts retention approximately as
well as many more traditional predictors of retention such as
cognitive ability and high school grades—although not as well
as some other noncognitive predictors. This suggests that the
assessment of grit may be useful in settings in which retention
is problematic (e.g., higher education) because it may allow

CREDÉ, TYNAN, AND HARMS

researchers to identify individuals who might benefit the most
from interventions that target grit or offer assistance in some
other fashion. Second—as noted earlier— our meta-analytic
results show that the perseverance of effort facet of grit exhibits
substantially higher criterion validity for the grade criteria than
the consistency of interest facet. Indeed, the observed criterion
validity of perseverance for the high school GPA criterion is
also significantly higher than the criterion validity observed for
overall grit scores and also for conscientiousness (Poropat,
2009). This suggests that the focus of grit researchers should
shift to perseverance as the most promising avenue of future
research. Third, our hierarchical regression results based on
meta-analytic estimates suggest that perseverance of effort
scores explain incremental variance over and above conscientiousness in the various grade criteria. This is, of course,
encouraging, but the only moderately high correlations among
scores on most personality traits assessed via two different
inventories (see Pace & Brannick, 2010) mean that such incremental validity findings would be observed even if grit was
simply a different manifestation of conscientiousness as our
other results suggest.
Even modest predictor-criterion relations can be very important in applied settings, especially when individuals’ standing
on the predictor can be impacted by simple interventions.
Whether it is possible to enhance grit via interventions is not yet
clear although evidence that social and personal skills as well as
resiliency are responsive to interventions (Durlak et al., 2010;
Paunesku et al., 2015) suggest that grit interventions may have
some positive effect. Although we do believe that our results
regarding the validity of the perseverance facet offer some
promise we also believe that our overall results should lead to
a reevaluation of the appropriateness of planned or existing grit
interventions. Schools and colleges have limited resources to
devote to interventions and are likely to be best served by
focusing those resources on variables that have been demonstrated to be (a) most strongly related to performance and
persistence/retention and (b) responsive to interventions. Fortunately there are a number of variables that meet both of those
requirements. For example, study skills and habits have been
shown to correlate approximately ␳ ⫽ .40 with college GPA
(Credé & Kuncel, 2008), while Hattie et al. (1996) showed that
study skills interventions can have moderate positive effects on
study skills. College students’ adjustment to college has been
shown to be similarly predictive of academic performance (␳ ⫽
.39 for academic adjustment), is also one of the best predictors
of retention in college (␳ ⫽ .29 for institutional attachment) and
can be slightly improved by simple interventions such as orientation programs (see Credé & Niehorster, 2012 for a review).
Simple class attendance is also very strongly related to academic performance, and making class attendance compulsory
appears to dramatically reduce the proportion of students who
fail a class (Credé et al., 2010). Study skills and study habits,
adjustment to college, and class attendance are thus far more
strongly related to academic performance and retention than
grit, and there is sound evidence that interventions can improve
students’ standing on these constructs (especially for study
skills and habits).

Limitations and Future Research
Meta-analyses are limited by the nature and quality of the
data present in a literature. As such this meta-analysis of the grit
literature has some notable limitations. First, the literature
relating grit to academic performance is primarily based on
concurrent designs. This, in turn, may have resulted in inflated
estimates of the grit-academic performance relation because
individuals’ knowledge of their academic performance may
influence their responses to the measure of grit. Second, there
are at least three reasons why the grit literature may be characterized by a nontrivial amount of range restriction. All of the
examined studies relied on self-reports of grit and the social
desirability of grit items may have resulted in range restriction
in self-reported grit scores. Individuals may also generally not
be aware of their true level of grit and unintentionally report
inflated levels of grit (Kruger & Dunning, 1999). Further,
samples drawn from populations that have been selected based
on prior performance may exhibit some range restriction on
grit. For example, cadets at the US Military Academy at West
Point have likely exhibited outstanding academic performance
in high school and may therefore have a lower range of grit
scores than the range found in the general population. We were
unable to correct for range restriction in our meta-analysis
because of the lack of normative data and the variability in how
the grit scales were used by researchers but future research may
be able to estimate the level of range restriction that is present
in samples. Third, many of the studies examining the relation
between grit and retention were characterized by very high base
rates of retention (i.e., low rates of dropout). Duckworth et al.
(2007) for example report data on one sample from the United
States Military Academy in which 94.2% of the sample were
retained through the examined period. Such low base rates
severely attenuate the size of the correlation that can be observed. In such circumstances meta-analyses could make corrections for range restriction, but such a correction would
require information about the size of the standard deviation for
the retention criteria in the general population and we are not
aware of a reasonable estimate for this value. Finally, although
the empirical grit literature is sufficiently large to allow us to
comment with relative confidence on average population effect
sizes the literature is not yet large enough to allow moderator
analyses characterized by high power (Hunter & Schmidt,
2004). An exploration of the reasons for the occasionally wide
credibility intervals will require the accumulation of further
data.
We believe that future research in this domain should consider five broad issues. First, researchers should attempt to
examine whether grit exhibit the type of stability that is associated with other personality traits or whether it is responsive to
interventions. Grit interventions will need to be tested to evaluate the malleability of grit but there are sound theoretical
reasons why such interventions may be effective. Eisenberger
(1992) argued that industriousness—a construct that is similar
to grit— can be acquired via reinforcement and that repeated
reinforcement for high effort (i.e., grit) can eventually result in
a generalized increase in effort across tasks even when these
tasks are not extrinsically reinforced. This work will not only
require long-term experimental manipulations in the form of

reinforcements for high effort but should help to establish the
degree to which grit is truly trait-like and also help to clarify the
type of grit interventions that are likely to be most effective.
Second, grit researchers should consider examining criteria that
span to different domains (e.g., work settings), a greater range
of difficulty and a greater variety of task types (e.g., intellective
tasks vs. creative tasks). This may help to establish boundary
conditions for the influence of grit on success and performance.
Third, grit researchers should consider examining the potential
moderators of the grit-performance relation discussed earlier:
the moderating role of the performance domain; the moderating
role of individual differences such as ability and metacognition;
and the moderating role of the level of grit. Fourth, it may also
be useful to examine the degree to which scores on measures of
grit are related to scores on measures of motivation. A popular
definition of motivation is that it reflects “an individual’s
intensity, direction, and persistence of effort toward achieving
a goal” (e.g., Robbins, Judge, & Campbell, 2010) and as such
bears clear conceptual similarities to grit. Finally, it is possible
that the grit literature may benefit from a refinement of the grit
scale using methods based on Item Response Theory. It is
unlikely that the relatively short measures of grit are equally
good at assessing low, medium, and high levels of grit. This
lack of depth and breadth in item content could lead to attenuation of the reported effects (see Credé, Harms, Niehorster, &
Gaye-Valentine, 2012). Better measures of grit would not only
help to clarify the nature of the grit-performance relation but
would also be important for the evaluation of future grit interventions.

Conclusion
Grit as a predictor of performance and success and as a focus of
interventions holds much intuitive appeal, but grit as it is currently
measured does not appear to be particularly predictive of success
and performance and also does not appear to be all that different to
conscientiousness. We hope that greater rigor in scale development, a greater focus on the perseverance facet, and a more
nuanced approach in study design will help future grit researchers
to develop boundary conditions for grit in its role as in influence
on performance and success.
